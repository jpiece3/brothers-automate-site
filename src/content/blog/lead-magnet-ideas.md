Here's a stat that should bother you: 97% of people who visit your website leave without doing anything. No email. No signup. No way to reach them again.

Most businesses try to fix this with a lead magnet. Good instinct. But most lead magnets are boring PDFs that get downloaded once and forgotten. The format isn't the problem. The idea behind it is.

We've built lead magnets for coaches, e-commerce brands, consultants, SaaS companies, and local businesses. After seeing what actually gets people to hand over their email -- and what gets ignored -- we put together this list of 21 lead magnet ideas ranked by real conversion potential. Not theory. Not what some marketing blog recycled from 2019. Ideas we've seen work, with specific examples for each.

Some of these take an afternoon to build. Others need real investment. We'll be honest about both.

## All 21 at a glance

| 21 | Curated reading list | Content | 3-6% |

The gap between #1 and #21 is enormous. A self-assessment quiz can convert 10x better than a curated reading list. That difference isn't about quality. It's about format and psychology.

Let's break each one down.

## Interactive lead magnet ideas (highest converting)

Interactive lead magnets outperform everything else because they give people something back. A PDF is a one-way transaction. An interactive experience creates a two-way conversation. People invest attention, answer questions, and receive personalized results. That investment makes them far more likely to follow through with their email.

Conversion range for this tier: **18-50%**

### 1. Self-assessment quiz

The single best lead magnet idea for most businesses, period. A self-assessment quiz asks 5-8 questions about someone's situation and delivers a personalized result. It works because people are curious about themselves -- always have been, always will be.

**Best for**: Coaches, consultants, and service businesses that need to segment leads by readiness or fit.

**Example**: A financial advisor creates "What's your retirement readiness score?" Prospects answer questions about savings rate, debt load, investment mix, and timeline. They get a score from 1-100 plus a one-page breakdown of their weakest area. The follow-up emails address that specific gap.

Quiz funnels convert at 30-50% because every question answered is a micro-commitment. By question five, walking away feels like wasting the effort they've already put in. And the data you collect -- what they struggle with, where they are in their buying process -- means your follow-up emails can actually speak to their situation instead of blasting everyone with the same generic sequence.

We've written about [why quiz funnels outperform PDFs by 2-3x](/blog/quiz-funnels-vs-pdf-lead-magnets) if you want the full comparison.

### 2. Readiness scorecard

Similar to a quiz but focused on one specific question: "Am I ready?" Readiness scorecards work particularly well because most prospects are stuck between wanting a change and actually doing something about it.

**Best for**: Any business where the buying decision involves overcoming inertia -- fitness, career coaching, B2B consulting, home renovation.

**Example**: A career transition coach builds "Are you ready to quit your 9-to-5?" The scorecard evaluates financial runway, skill transferability, market demand for their expertise, network strength, and risk tolerance. People get bucketed into "Not Yet," "Getting Close," or "Ready Now" -- and each bucket gets completely different email sequences.

The honesty is what makes this format sticky. Telling someone they're not ready yet *builds more trust* than telling everyone they should buy.

### 3. ROI calculator

Show people what they'd gain (or save) by using your product or service. Calculators convert well because the output is a dollar amount. That's concrete. That's motivating. Nobody screenshots a PDF, but people screenshot a calculator that says they're leaving $47,000 a year on the table.

**Best for**: SaaS, B2B services, marketing agencies, financial services.

**Example**: An HR software company creates "How much is employee turnover actually costing you?" Plug in company size, average salary, annual turnover rate, and hiring costs. The calculator spits out a number that usually shocks people -- and the follow-up sequence positions the product as the fix.

Building a real calculator takes development time. You can use Typeform or Outgrow for simpler versions, but the more tailored the output, the higher the conversion.

### 4. Product recommendation quiz

E-commerce brands, pay attention. A product recommendation quiz asks about preferences, needs, or goals and then recommends specific products from your catalog. It's a personal shopper experience disguised as a lead magnet.

**Best for**: E-commerce, subscription boxes, beauty brands, wellness companies, any business with multiple product options.

**Example**: A skincare brand builds "Find your perfect routine." Eight questions about skin type, concerns, climate, lifestyle, and budget. The result page shows a curated 3-product routine with direct add-to-cart links. Conversion from quiz to first purchase: 12-18%, compared to 2-4% from a generic discount popup.

This is one of the highest-converting formats in e-commerce and one of the most underused. Most online stores still rely on "Get 10% off your first order." A recommendation quiz gives you the discount's conversion power *plus* product-specific data on every lead.

### 5. Personalized action plan

Ask 5-7 questions about someone's goals and obstacles, then generate a custom plan based on their answers. This takes real work to build -- you need conditional logic mapping different answer combinations to different outputs. But the payoff is that people feel like they got a $200 consultation for free.

**Best for**: Business coaches, marketing consultants, health and fitness coaches.

**Example**: A business coach creates "Your 90-day growth plan." Questions cover revenue targets, team size, current marketing channels, biggest bottleneck, and available hours per week. A solopreneur at $5K/month gets different recommendations than a team of four at $30K/month. The specificity is what makes people trust you enough to take the next step.

### 6. Diagnostic tool

A diagnostic tool identifies a problem rather than recommending a solution. It answers the question "What's actually wrong?" before trying to fix anything. Doctors do this. Mechanics do this. And your prospects want it too.

**Best for**: IT services, marketing agencies, health practitioners, financial advisors.

**Example**: A digital marketing agency builds "Website conversion audit." Prospects answer questions about their traffic sources, bounce rate, page load time, and call-to-action placement. The tool scores their site across five categories and highlights the biggest leak in their funnel. The agency's follow-up offers to fix exactly that.

The diagnostic format positions you as the expert before you've ever had a sales conversation.

### 7. Interactive workshop

A live or on-demand workshop where participants actively do something rather than passively watch. The interactivity is the key -- not another webinar where you talk for 45 minutes and pitch for 15.

**Best for**: Course creators, coaches, consultants who teach a skill, SaaS companies doing product education.

**Example**: A Notion consultant runs "Build your project dashboard in 60 minutes." Attendees follow along and leave with a working Notion setup. Registration captures emails, and the follow-up sequence offers custom Notion builds for teams.

Interactive workshops convert at 18-28% registration rate and build significantly more trust than static content. The downside is they take real time to deliver. If you're going live, you're trading hours for leads. On-demand versions remove that bottleneck.

## Template and tool lead magnet ideas

Templates convert because they eliminate work. Your prospect has a task to do. You hand them something that's already 80% done. That's a genuinely useful trade for an email address.

Conversion range for this tier: **8-22%**

### 8. Spreadsheet template

A pre-built Google Sheet or Excel file that solves a specific operational pain. This isn't sexy. It doesn't go viral on social media. But it works because business owners and operators actually use it, which means they remember who gave it to them.

**Best for**: B2B services, financial professionals, project managers, operations-focused businesses.

**Example**: An accounting firm creates "The freelancer P&L tracker" -- a Google Sheet with pre-formatted categories, built-in formulas, and a monthly summary tab. It takes the accountant an hour to build and saves each freelancer ten hours over the next year.

### 9. Notion dashboard

Notion templates have become their own category of lead magnet over the past two years. The audience for this is growing fast and they're willing to trade their email for a well-built workspace.

**Best for**: Productivity coaches, project managers, content creators, anyone whose audience lives in Notion.

**Example**: A content strategist offers "The content calendar dashboard" -- a Notion template with editorial calendar, idea bank, publishing tracker, and performance log. One template page. Twenty minutes to duplicate and customize. The follow-up sequence sells a content strategy service.

### 10. Swipe file

A curated collection of real-world examples that people can reference or copy for their own work. Subject lines that got high open rates. Landing pages that converted well. Ad copy that drove sales. Cold emails that got replies.

**Best for**: Marketers, copywriters, salespeople, anyone in a role where seeing what works is as valuable as being told what works.

**Example**: "50 email subject lines that got 40%+ open rates (organized by industry)." Include the subject line, the industry, the list size, and the open rate. Specific beats generic every time.

Swipe files have a major advantage over most lead magnets: people come back to them repeatedly. That means your brand stays in front of them for weeks or months.

### 11. Checklist

The most familiar lead magnet format on the internet. Also one of the most underestimated. A good checklist converts at 10-16%. A bad one sits at 3%.

The difference? Specificity. "How to launch a podcast" is a blog post. "Pre-launch checklist: 31 things to complete before publishing episode one" is a lead magnet people will actually print out and pin to their wall.

**Best for**: Any business. Checklists are universal.

**Example for a local business**: A wedding venue creates "The wedding venue walkthrough checklist -- 22 questions to ask before you book." It positions the venue as transparent and helpful, and every couple who downloads it is a qualified lead.

### 12. Script and email templates

Copy-paste text for specific situations. Sales call scripts. Follow-up emails. Client onboarding messages. Objection-handling responses.

**Best for**: Sales teams, coaches, freelancers, anyone who writes repetitive emails or has repetitive conversations.

**Example**: A sales trainer offers "5 follow-up email scripts for when they ghost you after the proposal." Each script includes the subject line, the email body, and a brief note explaining the psychology behind why it works. People don't want theory about follow-ups. They want the actual words to send.

### 13. Planning framework

A repeatable structure for making decisions or completing a process. Frameworks feel more substantial than checklists because they include the reasoning behind each step.

**Best for**: Consultants, strategists, coaches who teach a methodology.

**Example**: A brand strategist offers "The brand positioning framework: the 6 questions that define your market angle." It's a one-page PDF with six questions, space for answers, and an example of a completed framework. Simple to create. Genuinely useful. And it naturally leads to "want help filling this out? Here's what we charge."

### 14. Comparison matrix

A side-by-side breakdown that helps people evaluate options. This format works when your audience is stuck comparing solutions and can't figure out which one fits their situation.

**Best for**: SaaS companies, agencies, consultants competing in a crowded market.

**Example**: A CRM consultant builds "CRM comparison matrix: HubSpot vs. Salesforce vs. Pipedrive vs. Close for businesses under 50 employees." A spreadsheet with 30+ feature comparisons, pricing tiers, integration lists, and a "best for" recommendation for each. The consultant's follow-up sequence helps with implementation, regardless of which CRM the prospect picks.

## Content-based lead magnet ideas

Content lead magnets are the easiest to create but the hardest to make convert well. The bar is higher than it used to be because free content is everywhere. To stand out, your content-based lead magnet needs to be genuinely better than what someone can find with a Google search.

Conversion range for this tier: **3-18%**

### 15. Mini email course

A 3-5 day email sequence where each message teaches one concept and includes a small action step. By the end, the subscriber has learned something real and you've built five days of trust.

**Best for**: Coaches, educators, SaaS companies doing user education.

**Example**: A productivity coach creates "5 Days to an Empty Inbox." Day 1: The triage system. Day 2: Unsubscribe ruthlessly. Day 3: Templates for common replies. Day 4: Processing schedule. Day 5: Maintaining zero. Each email is 400 words with one 10-minute exercise.

Mini-courses have a hidden advantage: they train subscribers to open your emails. Five days of valuable content sets a pattern. When your nurture sequence or sales emails arrive later, open rates stay high.

### 16. Video training

A short, focused video (10-20 minutes) that teaches one specific skill. Video outperforms written content for building personal connection because people see your face, hear your voice, and decide whether they trust you within seconds.

**Best for**: Coaches, course creators, consultants, personal brands.

**Example**: A public speaking coach records "How to open any presentation in 60 seconds (3 methods that actually work)." Fifteen minutes. Three specific techniques with demonstrations. No filler. The follow-up sequence promotes a full public speaking course.

Video training requires more production effort than text, but even a well-lit Loom recording outperforms a 20-page PDF for many audiences.

### 17. Case study collection

Three to five real stories showing before, during, and after results. Not testimonial quotes. Full narratives with specifics -- starting point, what changed, timeline, and measurable outcomes.

**Best for**: Service businesses, agencies, consultants, B2B companies.

**Example**: A marketing agency compiles "3 local businesses that doubled their leads in 90 days (and the exact campaigns they ran)." Each case study is 500-800 words with specific numbers: ad spend, lead count, cost per lead, revenue impact. The specificity is what separates this from a generic testimonial page.

### 18. Industry report

Original data about your market. Benchmarks, trends, survey results, aggregated anonymized data from your clients. Reports take more effort to produce but they earn backlinks, get shared on LinkedIn, and position you as someone who actually studies the space rather than just talking about it.

**Best for**: B2B companies, agencies, consultants, SaaS companies with interesting data.

**Example**: A recruiting firm publishes "2026 hiring benchmarks for tech startups under 100 employees." Data points on time-to-hire, offer acceptance rates, salary ranges by role, and remote work policies. Based on a survey of 200 companies plus internal data. This becomes a reference document people bookmark and share with their leadership team.

### 19. Resource toolkit

A curated collection of tools, templates, links, and recommendations bundled into one package. Better than a simple list because a toolkit is organized around a specific goal.

**Best for**: Anyone whose audience needs to assemble a stack of resources.

**Example**: A freelance consultant creates "The freelance starter toolkit" -- a package containing a contract template, invoice template, proposal template, list of recommended tools with discount codes, and a rate-setting worksheet. Each item on its own is fine. Bundled together, the perceived value jumps.

### 20. eBook or guide

The most common lead magnet format and, unfortunately, the most overused. Most eBooks convert poorly because people have downloaded hundreds of them and read approximately four. But a guide on a genuinely narrow topic with real depth can still work.

**Best for**: Businesses targeting audiences who prefer long-form content -- certain B2B segments, academics, technical fields.

**Example**: "The local restaurant's guide to getting 50 Google reviews in 30 days (without annoying your customers)." Twenty pages with the exact process, scripts to use, timing recommendations, and a QR code template. Narrow topic. Real depth. Actually useful. That's what separates a guide that converts from one that doesn't.

If you're new to lead magnets and aren't sure whether a guide is the right format, our [breakdown of what makes a lead magnet work](/blog/what-is-a-lead-magnet) covers the fundamentals.

### 21. Curated reading list

A list of recommended books, articles, podcasts, or courses on a specific topic. This is the lowest-effort lead magnet on the list. It's also the lowest-converting.

**Best for**: Thought leaders with strong curation taste, or as a bonus inside a higher-converting lead magnet.

Honest assessment: a reading list is easy to create but hard to justify trading an email for. Most people can Google "best books on [topic]" and get similar results. If this is your primary lead magnet, plan to upgrade soon.

Our recommendation? Use curated lists as bonus content inside a quiz result page or email sequence. They add value without carrying the conversion burden alone.

## How to pick the right lead magnet idea

Twenty-one options is a lot. Here's how to narrow it down based on your situation.

**Start with your audience's decision stage.** If they're problem-aware but not sure what to do, interactive formats (quizzes, scorecards, calculators) work best because they provide clarity. If they're already shopping for solutions, templates and tools work because they demonstrate your competence. If they're still learning, content-based magnets build trust over time.

**Factor in your resources.** A self-assessment quiz with scoring logic, personalized results, and automated email sequences takes real investment. If you've got a weekend and zero budget, a specific checklist or template is a better starting point. You can always upgrade later.

**Match the format to your business model.** Selling a service above $500? You need lead qualification. That means quizzes, scorecards, or diagnostic tools. Selling products under $50? Recommendation quizzes or discount-gated tools work. Selling courses? Mini email courses and video trainings preview the experience.

**Think about what happens after the opt-in.** The best lead magnet ideas aren't just about collecting emails. They're about collecting emails from people who are likely to buy. A [lead magnet funnel](/blog/lead-magnet-funnels-complete-guide) connects the opt-in to the sale through segmentation, scoring, and personalized follow-up. That's what turns a list into revenue.

One question we ask every client: "If you could know one thing about every lead before you talked to them, what would it be?" The answer usually points directly to the right format.

## FAQ

**How many lead magnets should I have?**

At least two. One for cold traffic (blog posts, social media, ads) and one for warm traffic (homepage, pricing page, about page). Cold traffic needs education -- a quiz or scorecard works well. Warm traffic needs a reason to act now -- a calculator or template fits better. If you're a [coach building your first one](/blog/lead-magnets-for-coaches), start with a single quiz and expand from there.

**What's the fastest lead magnet to create?**

A checklist or email template set. You can have either one live by tomorrow if you focus on a narrow topic you already know well. Write it in Google Docs, export as PDF, stick it behind an opt-in form on your landing page. Done. It won't convert like a quiz, but it's infinitely better than "subscribe to my newsletter."

**Do lead magnets still work in 2026?**

They work better than ever, but the bar has risen. A generic PDF guide that worked in 2019 won't cut it now. Interactive formats (quizzes, calculators, tools) are where the growth is because they give people personalized value. Static content lead magnets still work if the topic is specific enough and the quality is noticeably above what's free elsewhere.

**Should I gate my best content or give it away free?**

Gate the personalized stuff. Give away the general stuff. A blog post about "how to write email subject lines" should be free -- it builds organic traffic and trust. A swipe file of "50 proven subject lines organized by industry with open rate data" is worth gating because the curation and specificity add real value.
