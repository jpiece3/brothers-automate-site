A lead magnet funnel is a system that captures a visitor's contact information in exchange for something free, then automatically nurtures that person toward becoming a customer. It's not a single page or a single email. It's the entire path from "who are you?" to "take my money."

Most business owners we talk to have some version of a [lead magnet](/blog/what-is-a-lead-magnet). A PDF, a checklist, maybe a webinar recording collecting dust on a landing page somewhere. But the lead magnet itself is only one piece. The funnel is what turns that free thing into actual revenue.

We ran a food truck for 4.5 years before we started building these systems. Back then, our "lead magnet funnel" was handing out free samples at the window and hoping people came back tomorrow. It worked, sort of. But it didn't scale. And it definitely didn't work while we slept.

That's the whole point of building a real funnel around your lead magnet. You set it up once. It qualifies leads, nurtures them with the right messages, and sends you people who are actually ready to have a conversation. Not tire-kickers. Not freebie-seekers. Qualified leads.

This guide walks through every piece of a lead magnet funnel, the different types you can build, and the step-by-step process for putting one together. If you already know the basics and want to skip ahead to the build process, jump to [building your funnel step-by-step](#building-your-lead-magnet-funnel-step-by-step).

## What is a lead magnet funnel? (The short version)

A **lead magnet funnel** is the complete sequence a potential customer moves through after encountering your free offer. It starts with how they find it, includes the moment they hand over their email, and extends through every touchpoint until they buy or disengage.

Here's the simplest way to think about it:

**Free thing + Capture mechanism + Follow-up sequence + Sales conversation = Lead magnet funnel**

The "funnel" part matters because not everyone who enters will come out the other end as a customer. And that's by design. A good lead magnet funnel doesn't just collect emails. It filters. It sorts people by how ready they are to buy, what they need, and whether they're actually a fit for what you sell.

A bad funnel blasts the same generic emails to every subscriber and hopes for the best. A good one treats a first-time visitor differently than someone who's consumed three pieces of your content and clicked on your pricing page twice.

The conversion rate difference between these two approaches is enormous. Generic email sequences convert at roughly 1-2%. Segmented, behavior-based sequences convert at 5-8% or higher. Same traffic, same lead magnet, wildly different results.

If you take one thing from this entire guide, let it be this: the lead magnet gets them in the door. The funnel is the door, the hallway, the living room, and the conversation that happens once they sit down.

## The anatomy of a lead magnet funnel

Every lead magnet sales funnel has five core pieces. Skip one and the whole thing leaks. Here's what they are and why each one matters.

### The traffic source

Before anyone sees your lead magnet, they need to find it. Traffic sources are how people arrive at your funnel in the first place.

This could be organic search (someone Googles "how to get more coaching clients" and finds your blog post), paid ads (a Facebook ad promoting your free quiz), social media (an Instagram post linking to your opt-in page), or direct referrals.

The traffic source matters more than most people realize because it shapes expectations. Someone who clicked a Facebook ad is in a different headspace than someone who read your blog post for 8 minutes and then noticed your lead magnet. The ad-clicker is colder. The blog reader has already built some trust.

Your funnel should account for this. Ideally, your email sequence adapts based on where the lead came from. At minimum, you should be tracking UTM parameters so you know which sources produce leads that actually buy, not just leads that subscribe.

### The landing page

This is where the conversion happens. A dedicated page with one job: get the visitor to say "yes, I want that."

Landing pages that convert at 20%+ share a few traits. They have a clear headline that states the benefit, not the format. "Find out which marketing strategy fits your business" beats "Take our free quiz." They remove navigation menus and sidebars. Every link, every menu item, every footer widget is a potential exit. Kill them. The page has one button and one action.

They also address objections before they form. How long will this take? What will I get? Is this actually useful or is it a sales pitch in disguise? Answer these on the page.

One thing we've noticed after building dozens of these: the landing page copy matters less than the offer itself. You can have mediocre copy with a killer lead magnet and still convert well. But brilliant copy can't save a weak offer.

### The lead magnet itself

The actual thing you're giving away. This is what we covered in our [what is a lead magnet](/blog/what-is-a-lead-magnet) guide, but in the context of funnels, the format of your lead magnet has massive implications for everything that comes after.

A PDF guide gives you an email address. That's it. You know someone was interested enough to download, but you have zero insight into what they actually need, how urgent their problem is, or whether they can afford your solution.

An interactive lead magnet, like a quiz or assessment, gives you all of that. Every answer is data. By the time someone finishes a 7-question quiz, you know their business stage, their biggest pain point, their budget range, and their timeline. You've collected the same information a sales rep would gather in a 15-minute discovery call, and you did it before you even knew the person existed.

This is the single biggest reason quiz funnels convert 2-3x better than static lead magnets. It's not because quizzes are trendy. It's because they create a feedback loop that makes every subsequent step of the funnel more relevant to the person going through it.

### The thank you page (or results page)

Most businesses treat the thank you page as an afterthought. "Thanks for downloading! Check your email." Huge missed opportunity.

This page has the highest engagement rate of any page in your funnel. The person just took an action. They're paying attention. They're waiting. This is the moment to:

- Deliver the lead magnet or results immediately (don't make them check email first)
- Set expectations for what happens next ("You'll get an email from us in the next 5 minutes, then 3 more over the next week")
- Offer a logical next step (book a call, watch a video, explore your service page)
- Reinforce that they made a good decision

For quiz funnels specifically, the results page is where the magic happens. You show them a personalized result based on their answers. "You're The Overwhelmed Operator" or "Your marketing is a 7/10, but your follow-up is a 3/10." This personalization builds trust fast because the person feels seen. You clearly understand their situation, and you didn't even talk to them.

### The email sequence

Here's where most lead magnet funnels fall apart. Someone downloads your free thing, gets one "here's your download" email, and then either hears nothing for weeks or gets hit with an immediate sales pitch.

Neither works.

A proper nurture sequence does a few things over 5-14 emails spread across 2-4 weeks. The first email delivers what they signed up for. Immediately. No delays, no "check your inbox in a few minutes." The next 2-3 emails provide more value related to the lead magnet topic. You're building authority and trust. Then you start weaving in your offer. Not a hard pitch. A natural transition from "here's how to solve this problem" to "here's how we solve this problem for people like you."

The final emails in the sequence get more direct. Case studies, testimonials, limited offers, "reply to this email if you have questions."

For quiz funnels, this is where segmentation pays off massively. Instead of one generic email sequence for every subscriber, you have different paths. Someone who scored "hot" gets a shorter sequence with a stronger call to action. Someone who scored "cold" gets a longer nurture with more educational content. The emails reference their specific quiz answers, which makes the communication feel personal even though it's completely automated.

The system handles it while you're back to doing what you do best.

### The conversion point

The end of the funnel is where a lead becomes a customer. For most service businesses, this is a sales call or consultation. For e-commerce, it might be a product page visit. For course creators, it could be a sales page or checkout.

Your funnel should explicitly guide people here. Every email has a CTA. The results page has a CTA. Even your lead magnet content should include a natural bridge to the next step.

But here's the thing most people miss: the conversion point isn't just "book a call." It's "book a call, and when they show up, you already know their business stage, their main challenge, and their readiness to invest." When your funnel qualifies leads properly, your close rate on sales calls jumps from 15-20% to 40-60%. That's not a guess. That's what we see across the funnels we've built.

## Types of lead magnet funnels

Not all funnels are built the same. The type of lead magnet you choose shapes the entire funnel structure, and some types perform dramatically better than others.

### PDF and checklist funnels

The most common type. You create a downloadable resource, put up a landing page with an email form, and set up a basic email sequence.

**How it works:** Visitor sees landing page, enters email, gets PDF via email, receives a follow-up sequence.

**Typical conversion rates:** Landing page opt-in: 15-25%. Email-to-customer: 1-3%.

**Strengths:** Cheap and fast to create. You can have one live in a day. Low tech barrier. Tools like ConvertKit or Mailchimp handle everything.

**Weaknesses:** Zero lead qualification. Everyone gets the same experience regardless of their needs or readiness. The PDF might never get opened (47% of downloaded PDFs are never read). Follow-up emails have to be generic because you don't know anything about the person beyond their email address.

PDF funnels are a fine starting point. But if you're getting more than 200 visitors a month to your lead magnet, you're leaving money on the table with this approach.

### Webinar funnels

A registration-based funnel where the lead magnet is access to a live or recorded presentation.

**How it works:** Visitor registers for the webinar, attends (or watches the replay), receives post-webinar follow-up emails with an offer.

**Typical conversion rates:** Registration page: 20-40%. Show-up rate: 25-40% live, higher for automated replays. Attendee-to-customer: 5-15%.

**Strengths:** High perceived value. Builds strong personal connection. You can address objections in real-time during live events.

**Weaknesses:** Time-intensive to create and deliver. Attendance drop-off is brutal. Requires scheduling coordination. Replay viewers convert at lower rates. The funnel has a delay built into it (you have to wait for the webinar date).

Webinar funnels work well for high-ticket offers ($2,000+) where the personal connection justifies the time investment.

### Free tool and calculator funnels

You build a small interactive tool that solves a specific problem, then gate the results behind an email capture.

**How it works:** Visitor uses the tool (ROI calculator, pricing estimator, grading tool), enters email to get their results, receives follow-up emails.

**Typical conversion rates:** Tool completion: 40-60%. Email capture: 30-50% of completers. Email-to-customer: 3-5%.

**Strengths:** High engagement. Genuinely useful. Creates a personalized experience. Visitors spend 3-5 minutes interacting with your brand.

**Weaknesses:** More expensive to build. Requires development resources. Can be hard to maintain if inputs or formulas change.

### Challenge funnels

A multi-day commitment where participants complete tasks and engage with you over 3-7 days.

**How it works:** Visitor signs up for the challenge, receives daily emails or lessons with assignments, community engagement happens in a Facebook group or Slack, final day includes a pitch for your paid offer.

**Typical conversion rates:** Sign-up: 15-30%. Completion rate: 10-20%. Completer-to-customer: 10-25%.

**Strengths:** Deep engagement and relationship building. People who complete the challenge are extremely warm leads. Strong community element.

**Weaknesses:** Massive time commitment to run. Low completion rates mean most leads fall off. Doesn't scale easily. Hard to automate fully (honestly, this is the part most people skip when they talk about challenge funnels: someone has to actually show up every day and engage).

### Quiz funnels

An interactive assessment that collects data through questions, then delivers personalized results and segmented follow-up.

**How it works:** Visitor takes a quiz (5-7 questions), enters email to see results, receives a personalized result page, enters a segmented email sequence based on their answers.

**Typical conversion rates:** Quiz start rate: 70-85% of landing page visitors. Quiz completion: 80-90% of starters. Email capture: 40-60% of completers. Email-to-customer: 5-12%.

**Strengths:** Highest engagement of any lead magnet type. Every answer is a data point for segmentation. Personalized results build trust and authority. Follow-up emails can reference specific answers. Lead scoring happens automatically. Works 24/7 with no manual involvement.

**Weaknesses:** More complex to build than a PDF funnel. Requires strategic question design (bad questions produce bad data). The copy, design, and logic need to work together.

The numbers speak for themselves. Quiz funnels have the highest overall conversion rate from visitor to customer of any lead magnet funnel type. And unlike webinars or challenges, they run completely on autopilot.

### Head-to-head comparison

| Funnel Type | Setup Time | Ongoing Effort | Lead Quality | Visitor-to-Customer Rate |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------------|
| PDF/Checklist | 1-2 days | Low | Unqualified | 0.3-0.8% |
| Webinar | 1-2 weeks | High (live) | Moderate | 1.5-6% |
| Free Tool | 2-4 weeks | Medium | Moderate | 1.2-3% |
| Challenge | 1-2 weeks | Very High | High (completers only) | 1.5-5% |
| Quiz | 1-2 weeks | Low | High (scored) | 2-7% |

The "visitor-to-customer rate" multiplies all the drop-off points together: landing page conversion, completion rate, email capture rate, and email-to-customer conversion. Quiz funnels win because they maintain high engagement at every step.

## Building your lead magnet funnel step-by-step

Whether you're building a PDF funnel, a quiz funnel, or anything in between, these steps apply. We'll call out where the process differs for interactive lead magnets.

### Step 1: Define who you're building this for

Not "small business owners." Not "entrepreneurs." Get specific.

Write down: What's their job title or role? What do they Google at 11pm when they can't sleep? What have they already tried that didn't work? What would make them say "this person gets me" within 30 seconds?

Example: "Online fitness coaches making $5K-$15K/month who are getting leads from Instagram but can't convert DM conversations into paying clients. They've tried selling in the DMs, running free challenges, and posting daily, but their close rate on discovery calls is under 15%."

That's a person you can build a funnel for. "Fitness coaches" is not.

The more specific your audience definition, the better every other piece of the funnel performs. Your landing page headline will be sharper. Your lead magnet will be more relevant. Your emails will feel like they were written specifically for the reader. Because they were.

### Step 2: Map the problem-to-product bridge

Your lead magnet needs to sit in the gap between a problem your audience has and the solution you sell. This sounds obvious, but it's where most funnels break down.

Bad bridge: You sell marketing services, and your lead magnet is "10 Productivity Tips for Entrepreneurs." It might get downloads, but those people aren't thinking about marketing. They're thinking about productivity. Your follow-up emails about marketing services will feel random.

Good bridge: You sell marketing services, and your lead magnet is "What's Your Marketing Blind Spot? Take the 2-Minute Assessment." Now every person who enters your funnel is already thinking about marketing. The bridge from "here's your blind spot" to "here's how we fix it" is natural.

Write this out: "My audience struggles with [problem]. My lead magnet helps them understand [specific aspect of problem]. My product/service solves [problem] by [mechanism]. The lead magnet makes them realize they need [what I sell]."

### Step 3: Choose your format

For a lead magnet funnel template you can reuse, pick the format based on two factors: how much data you need about your leads, and how much time you're willing to invest upfront.

If you need zero lead qualification data and want something live today: PDF, checklist, or cheat sheet. Time: 1-2 days.

If you need moderate qualification and have 1-2 weeks: Calculator, assessment, or video series. Time: 1-2 weeks.

If you need full lead scoring with personalized follow-up: Quiz funnel with segmented email sequences. Time: 1-2 weeks (or less if you work with someone who builds these regularly).

We're biased, but the math is pretty clear. If you're spending money on ads or investing significant time in content marketing, sending that traffic to a PDF download is like running a restaurant where you seat every customer at the same table and serve them the same dish regardless of what they ordered. Some will like it. Most will leave.

### Step 4: Build the capture mechanism

For PDF funnels, this is straightforward. Create a landing page with a headline, 3-4 bullet points about what they'll get, and an email form. Tools: ConvertKit, Leadpages, Carrd, or even a simple page on your existing site.

For quiz funnels, you're building something more involved:

**The landing page** needs to promise a personalized result, not just a free thing. "Discover your marketing blind spot in 2 minutes" creates more curiosity than "Download our marketing guide."

**The quiz itself** should be 5-7 questions. Fewer feels too shallow ("that only asked me 3 things, how can it know anything?"). More than 9 and completion rates drop sharply. Each question should collect data you'll actually use for segmentation or scoring.

**The results page** delivers a personalized outcome based on their answers. This is where trust gets built. "Based on your answers, your biggest growth bottleneck is lead qualification, not lead volume. Here's why..."

**The email capture** sits between the last question and the results. "Enter your email to see your full results and get a custom action plan." This placement converts at 40-60% because curiosity about results is a strong motivator.

### Step 5: Write the email sequence

This is where most people stall. Writing one email is easy. Writing a 7-14 email sequence that progressively builds trust and moves toward a sale requires structure.

Here's a framework that works:

**Email 1 (Day 0):** Deliver what they signed up for. For quizzes, recap their result and give one actionable insight. For PDFs, include the download link and one tip they'll find inside. Keep it short.

**Email 2 (Day 1):** Introduce yourself briefly. Not your life story, but enough to build credibility. Why should they listen to you? What experience do you bring? One paragraph, max.

**Emails 3-5 (Days 3, 5, 7):** Value emails. Each one addresses a specific problem related to their lead magnet topic. Teach something useful. Include one "by the way, this is what we help with" mention per email. Not a pitch. A mention.

**Email 6 (Day 9):** The bridge email. This is where you transition from pure value to your offer. Tell a story about a client who had the same problem and how you solved it. Include a specific result. "Sarah was getting 200 leads a month from her PDF download but only 3 were booking calls. After we rebuilt her funnel as a quiz, her call bookings jumped to 22 per month. Same traffic."

**Emails 7-8 (Days 11, 14):** Direct offer emails. Here's what we do, here's what it costs, here's who it's for, here's how to get started. Be clear, be direct, no tricks.

For quiz funnels, you'll have multiple versions of at least emails 3-5, tailored to each quiz result segment. Someone who scored "hot" might skip straight to email 6 content by day 3.

### Step 6: Connect the tracking

You can't improve what you don't measure. At minimum, track these numbers:

- Landing page visitors (total and by source)
- Opt-in rate (emails captured / visitors)
- For quizzes: start rate, completion rate, email capture rate
- Email open rates and click rates for each email
- Sales calls booked (or purchases made)
- Revenue generated from funnel leads

Set up UTM parameters on every link pointing to your funnel. This tells you whether your Instagram post, your blog sidebar, or your Facebook ad is sending you leads that actually convert. You might find that your organic traffic converts at 8% while your paid traffic converts at 2%. That changes how you allocate your budget.

If you're using a quiz funnel with lead scoring, you also want to track the distribution of lead temperatures. If 70% of your quiz takers score "cold," your questions might need adjusting. Or your traffic source might be too broad.

### Step 7: Launch and iterate

Your first version won't be your best version. Ship it.

Give it 2-4 weeks and at least 200 visitors before you make judgment calls. Then look at where the drop-off happens. If people visit the landing page but don't start the quiz, your headline or page design needs work. If they start but don't finish, your questions are too long, too boring, or too personal too early. If they finish but don't enter their email, your results aren't compelling enough to gate. If they enter their email but never open your emails, your subject lines or sending frequency needs adjusting.

Fix the biggest leak first. Then move to the next one. This is how you go from a 2% visitor-to-lead conversion to 8%+ over a few months.

## What separates good funnels from great ones

The steps above will get you a working lead magnet funnel. Here's what separates the ones that generate consistent revenue from the ones that collect dust.

### Personalization at every stage

Great funnels don't treat everyone the same. The landing page copy might change based on the traffic source. The results page shows different content based on quiz answers. The email sequence branches based on engagement.

This is where interactive lead magnets leave static ones in the dust. When someone answers 7 questions about their business, you have enough data to personalize every single touchpoint after that. Their results page is unique. Their emails reference their specific situation. Their CTA matches their readiness level.

A coach who told you they're making $15K/month and struggling with sales call conversions gets different emails than one making $3K/month who needs more traffic. Both entered the same funnel. Both get a relevant experience. That's personalization, and it's the single biggest factor in funnel performance.

### Automatic lead scoring

Great funnels score leads so you know who to prioritize. Not all leads are equal. Someone who completes your quiz, opens 5 of 7 emails, and clicks on your pricing page is a fundamentally different lead than someone who entered their email and went silent.

With quiz funnels, scoring starts the moment they answer the first question. By the time they finish, you can categorize them as hot, warm, or cold based on their answers. Budget questions, timeline questions, urgency indicators. All collected naturally as part of an engaging experience.

Hot leads go straight to your calendar link. Warm leads get a nurture sequence that builds more trust. Cold leads get a longer educational drip. This saves you hours you'd otherwise spend on discovery calls with people who were never going to buy.

### Speed to response

The lead who submitted your form 3 minutes ago is 21x more likely to enter your sales process than the one you follow up with 30 minutes later. That stat comes from research by Lead Connect, and it's one of the most underappreciated factors in funnel performance.

Great funnels respond instantly. The thank you page loads in under 2 seconds. The first email arrives within 60 seconds. If you have a high-intent lead (hot score from a quiz), an automated notification pings you or your sales team immediately.

This is one reason done-for-you funnels outperform DIY setups. The technical pieces (fast email delivery, instant notifications, real-time lead routing) need to be bulletproof. A 5-minute delay in your email delivery because your automation platform is slow can cut your conversion rate in half.

### Content that educates instead of sells

The best funnel emails don't feel like marketing. They feel like a smart friend sending you an article that's relevant to what you're dealing with.

This takes more effort. It's easier to write "Book a call! Limited spots!" for every email. But the funnels that generate consistent $10K+ months are the ones where subscribers reply to emails saying "this is exactly what I needed to hear." Where people forward your emails to colleagues.

Sell by teaching. When you teach someone how lead qualification works and why most funnels fail at it, you don't need to convince them your quiz funnel service is worth the investment. They've already connected the dots.

## Common mistakes that kill lead magnet funnels

### Asking for too much information upfront

Name, email, phone number, company name, company size, annual revenue, favorite color.

Stop. Every additional form field reduces your conversion rate by roughly 10%. For the initial opt-in, you need an email address. That's it. Maybe a first name if your email platform can personalize with it. Everything else can be collected through quiz questions (which feel like content, not interrogation) or progressive profiling in later emails.

### Sending the same sequence to everyone

If your funnel has one email sequence and everyone gets the same emails regardless of how they entered or what they told you, you're leaving 40-60% of potential conversions on the table.

Even basic segmentation helps. Split your list into "engaged" (opens emails, clicks links) and "disengaged" (hasn't opened in 2 weeks). Send re-engagement campaigns to the second group. Send your offers to the first group. That alone will improve your numbers.

For quiz funnels, segment by result type and lead temperature. Someone who scored "hot" and told you they're "ready to start this month" should not receive the same 14-day nurture drip as someone who's "just exploring options." That hot lead might buy on day 2 if you make the offer. Making them wait 14 days while you "nurture" them is actually losing you money.

### Neglecting mobile experience

62% of lead magnet funnel traffic comes from mobile devices. If your landing page, quiz, or emails look broken on a phone, you're losing the majority of your potential leads.

Test everything on your phone before you launch. Not just "does it load," but "is it easy to use with my thumb?" Can someone complete your quiz one-handed while standing in line for coffee? If yes, you're good. If they have to pinch and zoom or tap tiny buttons, fix it.

### No follow-up after the sequence ends

Your email sequence runs for 14 days and then... silence. The lead is still on your list, but they never hear from you again unless they happen to get your monthly newsletter (if you even send one).

Great funnels have a long-tail strategy. After the initial sequence, subscribers move into a weekly or bi-weekly value email. You stay top of mind. When they're finally ready to buy (which might be 3 months later), you're the first person they think of, not someone they vaguely remember downloading something from.

### Optimizing the wrong metric

"We got 500 new email subscribers this month!" Cool. How many became customers? If the answer is 2, your 500-subscriber celebration is premature.

Track revenue per lead, not just lead volume. It's better to have 100 qualified leads that produce 15 customers than 500 unqualified leads that produce 2. This is why lead qualification in the funnel matters so much. A smaller number of better-fit leads will always outperform a giant list of people who downloaded your free thing and forgot about you.

## Frequently asked questions

### How much does a lead magnet funnel cost to build?

A basic PDF funnel with a landing page and 5-email sequence can be built for under $100 using tools like ConvertKit (free plan), Canva (free), and your existing website. A quiz funnel with full lead scoring, personalized results, and segmented email sequences typically runs $1,500-$5,000 if you hire someone, or 40-80 hours of your own time if you DIY it. [We build done-for-you quiz funnels for $2,500](/what-you-get), which includes research, copy, design, deployment, and 26 email sequences.

### How long does it take to see results?

Expect 2-4 weeks of data collection before you can draw conclusions. You need at least 200-300 visitors to your landing page to have a statistically meaningful sample. If you're running paid ads, you could hit this in the first week. Organic traffic takes longer. Most of our clients see their first funnel-attributed sale within 30 days of launch.

### Can I build a lead magnet funnel without a website?

Yes, but it's not ideal long-term. Tools like Carrd, Leadpages, or even a standalone Typeform can serve as your landing page and capture mechanism. You don't need a full website to start. But you'll want one eventually because it builds credibility and gives you a home for the content marketing that drives organic traffic to your funnel.

### What's the difference between a lead magnet and a lead magnet funnel?

A lead magnet is the free resource itself: the quiz, the PDF, the checklist. A lead magnet funnel is the entire system surrounding it: how people find it, how they opt in, what happens after they opt in, and how they eventually become customers. Think of the lead magnet as the bait and the funnel as the entire fishing operation including the rod, the reel, the boat, and where you decide to cast.

### How many emails should my funnel sequence have?

Between 5 and 14, depending on your offer price and complexity. For offers under $500, a 5-7 email sequence over 10-14 days is usually enough. For offers over $2,000, plan on 10-14 emails over 3-4 weeks. The higher the price, the more trust you need to build. But more emails doesn't always mean better. Eight well-written, relevant emails will outperform 20 generic ones every time.

### Should I use a quiz or a PDF as my lead magnet?

If you sell a service where knowing your prospect's situation beforehand would help you close more deals, use a quiz. If you sell a commodity product where all customers need the same thing, a PDF works fine. For coaches, consultants, course creators, and service businesses, quizzes almost always outperform PDFs because the personalization creates stronger engagement and the data enables smarter follow-up.

## Start building your lead magnet funnel

You've got the framework. You know the components, the types, the build process, and the mistakes to avoid. The question now is whether you build it yourself or get someone to build it for you.

If you've got the time and enjoy the tech side, the steps above give you everything you need to create a funnel that works. Start simple. A PDF funnel you can launch this week beats a perfect quiz funnel you plan for six months.

If you'd rather skip the build and have a done-for-you quiz funnel generating qualified leads while you sleep, that's what we do. Research, copy, design, development, 26 email sequences, lead scoring, analytics dashboard, deployed and running. [See exactly what's included](/what-you-get) or [take our quiz](https://quiz.brothersautomate.com) to find out if it's the right fit.

Either way, stop sending traffic to a page with no capture mechanism. Every day without a funnel is leads walking past your business and never coming back.
