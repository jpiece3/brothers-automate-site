Drip campaigns make up about 2-3% of a brand's total email volume. They generate 320% more revenue than non-automated emails ([Omnisend, 2024](https://www.omnisend.com/resources/reports/email-marketing-statistics/)). That's the math behind every **email drip campaign** worth building -- a tiny fraction of your sends doing a wildly disproportionate amount of the revenue work.

Most businesses read a stat like that, nod, and then go back to sending the same monthly newsletter to their entire list. Same message. Same timing. Same results. Meanwhile, the businesses actually growing have sequences running in the background that deliver the right email to the right person based on what that person actually did.

We've built drip campaigns for coaches, consultants, course creators, and service businesses. The ones that print money share a few things in common. The ones that flop almost always make the same mistakes. This post covers both sides.

## What Is an Email Drip Campaign?

An **email drip campaign** is a pre-written sequence of emails that sends automatically based on a trigger. Someone signs up for your list, buys a product, abandons a cart, or completes a quiz -- and the system fires off a series of emails on a set schedule without you lifting a finger.

The "drip" part is literal. Instead of dumping everything on a subscriber at once, you drip content over days or weeks. Email one lands immediately. Email two arrives two days later. Email four shows up on day seven. Each one has a specific job, and that job feeds into the next.

Here's what a drip campaign is **not**: a newsletter. A newsletter goes to everyone on your list at the same time with the same content. A drip campaign is triggered by individual behavior and runs on its own timeline for each subscriber. Two people can sign up six months apart and both get the same carefully planned sequence starting from day one.

It's also not a one-off promotional blast. Those have their place, but they're a megaphone. A drip campaign is a conversation.

### How It Works in Practice

Say someone downloads your free pricing guide. Here's what happens:

- **Minute 0:** They get an email with the download link. Fast. No waiting.
- **Day 1:** A follow-up asking what brought them to your site. Gets a reply, gives you data.
- **Day 3:** A short case study showing how someone in their position got results.
- **Day 5:** A teaching email -- one specific tactic they can use today.
- **Day 7:** An introduction to your paid offer. Not a hard sell. A clear explanation of what it is and who it's for.

That's five emails. Built once. Running forever. Every new subscriber gets the same experience whether you're at your desk, on vacation, or asleep. The system handles it.

## Why Drip Campaigns Outperform One-Off Emails

The numbers here aren't subtle. They're lopsided.

Automated drip sequences deliver [119% higher click rates](https://cleartailmarketing.com/drip-campaign-best-practices/) compared to standard promotional emails. Their average open rate sits at 42.1% with a 5.4% click rate ([GetResponse, 2024](https://www.getresponse.com/resources/reports/email-marketing-benchmarks)). Compare that to batch promotional emails averaging 25% opens and 1.5% clicks.

Welcome drip series alone drive 39% of total email revenue while making up just 1.22% of sends ([Omnisend](https://www.omnisend.com/resources/reports/email-marketing-statistics/)). Read that ratio again. One percent of your email volume doing nearly 40% of the work.

Why the gap? Two reasons.

**Timing.** A drip email arrives when someone is already paying attention. They just signed up, just purchased, just abandoned something. The email meets them in a moment of actual intent. A batch blast arrives whenever you decided to send it -- which has nothing to do with where the subscriber is in their decision process.

**Relevance.** A well-built drip campaign segments people into different paths based on what they did. A lead who scored "hot" on your quiz gets a different sequence than someone who scored "cool." A customer who bought Product A doesn't get hammered with emails about Product A. The content matches the context, and that's why it works.

This is why we think [email marketing automation](/blog/email-marketing-automation) isn't optional anymore. It's the difference between treating your email list like a megaphone and treating it like a system that builds relationships at scale.

## 7 Types of Email Drip Campaigns (With Examples)

Not all drip campaigns do the same job. Here are seven that cover the full customer lifecycle, from first touch to repeat purchase.

### 1. Welcome Series

**Trigger:** New email subscriber (any source).

This is your most valuable drip campaign. Period. Welcome emails generate 320% more revenue per email than promotional messages, and subscribers are more engaged in the first 48 hours than at any other point in your relationship with them.

**Structure:** 4-5 emails over 7-10 days.

- Email 1 (Day 0): Deliver what they signed up for. Resource link in the first two lines. Set expectations.
- Email 2 (Day 1): Personal follow-up. Ask one question. Get a reply.
- Email 3 (Day 3): Teach something. Share a perspective they haven't heard.
- Email 4 (Day 5): Show a result. Mini case study, 150 words max.
- Email 5 (Day 7): Introduce your offer. Clear, not pushy.

**Example subject line progression:** "Here's your [resource]" → "Quick question" → "The mistake costing most [audience] 40% of their leads" → "What [Name] did differently" → "Is this a fit?"

### 2. Onboarding Drip

**Trigger:** New customer or free trial signup.

The goal isn't to sell -- they already bought. The goal is to get them using the product so they don't churn. Onboarding drips reduce churn by guiding people through the "aha moment" faster.

**Structure:** 5-6 emails over 14 days, focused on one action per email.

- Email 1: "Here's how to get started in 5 minutes"
- Email 2: "Did you try [core feature]?"
- Email 3: A quick win tutorial
- Email 4: Advanced tip or hidden feature
- Email 5: Check-in -- "How's it going?"
- Email 6: Social proof from another customer in a similar situation

### 3. Lead Nurturing Drip

**Trigger:** Subscriber finishes welcome series without buying.

This is where most businesses drop the ball. Someone didn't buy after your welcome sequence? That doesn't mean they're not interested. It means they're not ready yet. A nurture drip keeps you in their inbox -- delivering value, building trust, staying top of mind -- until they are.

**Structure:** 6-8 emails over 30-45 days.

Focus on education, not pitching. Share insights. Answer common objections without being salesy about it. Every fourth or fifth email can include a soft mention of your offer, but the ratio should be 80% value, 20% promotion.

### 4. Abandoned Cart Recovery

**Trigger:** Cart created but checkout not completed.

Abandoned cart drip emails hit a 39.07% open rate and 10.7% conversion rate ([Omnisend](https://www.omnisend.com/resources/reports/email-marketing-statistics/)). That's real money sitting on the table.

**Structure:** 4 emails over 72 hours.

- Email 1 (1 hour): Simple reminder. "You left something behind." No discount yet.
- Email 2 (24 hours): Address the likely objection. Shipping? Returns? Security?
- Email 3 (48 hours): Social proof. Reviews, testimonials, "here's what other customers said."
- Email 4 (72 hours): Final nudge. Small incentive if you want. 10% off or free shipping. Last chance framing.

**Our take:** Don't lead with the discount. Too many businesses train their customers to abandon carts on purpose because they know a coupon is coming. Address objections first. Save the incentive for the final email.

### 5. Re-Engagement Drip

**Trigger:** No email opens or clicks for 60-90 days.

Dead weight on your list hurts deliverability. Re-engagement drips either wake people up or give you permission to remove them. Both outcomes are good.

**Structure:** 4 emails over 14 days.

- Email 1: "We miss you" with a compelling reason to come back
- Email 2: Share your best-performing content piece
- Email 3: Ask directly -- "Do you still want to hear from us?"
- Email 4: "We're removing you from the list unless you click here"

That last email sounds aggressive. It works. People who don't click get removed. Your list gets healthier, your open rates go up, and your email provider stops flagging you.

### 6. Post-Purchase Follow-Up

**Trigger:** Purchase completed.

The sale isn't the finish line. It's the starting line for the next sale, a referral, or a review. Post-purchase drips turn one-time buyers into repeat customers.

**Structure:** 5 emails over 30 days.

- Email 1 (Day 0): Order confirmation + "here's what to expect"
- Email 2 (Day 3): "How to get the most out of [product]"
- Email 3 (Day 7): Ask for feedback or a review
- Email 4 (Day 14): Related product recommendation (not a hard upsell -- "customers who bought X also found Y useful")
- Email 5 (Day 30): Check-in + loyalty offer or referral ask

### 7. Quiz-Based Behavioral Drip

**Trigger:** Prospect completes an assessment, quiz, or scorecard.

This is the one most businesses don't know about -- and the one we think changes everything about drip campaigns.

A standard drip treats every subscriber the same. Same emails. Same timing. Same content. A quiz-based behavioral drip segments people *before* the first email even sends. The quiz captures what someone cares about, where they're stuck, and how ready they are to take action. Then the drip campaign branches based on those answers.

Here's what that looks like:

- Someone scores "hot" (high intent, clear problem, ready to act) → they get a 4-email fast-track sequence with a call booking link in email two.
- Someone scores "warm" (interested but not urgent) → they get a 6-email nurture sequence with case studies and educational content.
- Someone scores "cool" (early stage, just exploring) → they get an 8-email long-game sequence that builds awareness over 45 days.
- Someone who mentioned a specific pain point in question two → they get answer-aware emails that reference that exact struggle in the subject line and body copy.

Each email references their specific quiz answers. Not just "Hi {first_name}" personalization. Actual content blocks that change based on what they told you. "You mentioned that following up with leads is your biggest time drain -- here's how one coach automated that completely."

This is what we build at Brothers Automate. Quiz funnels with lead scoring, temperature routing, and 26 behavior-triggered emails that adapt to each person. We've seen these outperform standard welcome sequences by 2-4x on click rates because every email feels like it was written specifically for that subscriber. Because, in a real sense, it was.

Want to see how this works in practice? Here's how [quiz funnels generate qualified leads](/blog/how-quiz-funnels-generate-qualified-leads) -- including the scoring logic and email branching behind it.

## How to Build an Email Drip Campaign in 5 Steps

You don't need enterprise software or a marketing team. You need a clear goal, a trigger, and emails that actually help people. Here's the process.

### Step 1: Define Your Goal and Audience

Every drip campaign exists to move someone from Point A to Point B. Before you write a single email, answer two questions:

- **What's the trigger?** (What action starts this sequence?)
- **What's the desired outcome?** (What do you want subscribers to do by the end?)

If you're starting from zero and don't have an email list yet, back up. First, [build your email list](/blog/build-email-list-from-scratch) with a lead magnet or quiz that attracts the right people. A drip campaign only works if the people entering it are actually your target audience.

Map out your [email funnel](/blog/what-is-an-email-funnel) before writing any copy. Know how many emails you need, what each one does, and where it sits in the sequence.

### Step 2: Map the Trigger and Flow

Draw it out. Seriously. Pen and paper, whiteboard, whatever. Map the trigger event, each email in the sequence, the timing between them, and any conditional branches.

A basic flow looks like this:

- Trigger → Email 1 (immediate) → Wait 2 days → Email 2 → Wait 2 days → Email 3 → Wait 3 days → Email 4 → Wait 4 days → Email 5

A behavior-triggered flow adds branches:

- Trigger → Email 1 (immediate) → Did they click the link?
  - Yes → Send Email 2A (case study, faster pace)
  - No → Send Email 2B (different angle, re-engagement)

The branch logic is where drip campaigns get powerful. But start simple. A linear five-email sequence with good content will outperform a complicated branching flow with mediocre emails.

### Step 3: Write Emails That Help Before They Sell

This is where most drip campaigns die. The business owner writes five thinly disguised sales pitches and wonders why nobody clicks.

Here's our rule: if a subscriber forwarded your email to a friend, would it be useful to that friend even if they never bought anything from you? If yes, the email passes. If no, rewrite it.

The ratio we use: give value in four out of five emails. The fifth can sell. But even the selling email should lead with a benefit, not a feature list.

**What "value" actually means in a drip email:**

- A specific, actionable tactic they can use today
- A story that makes them feel understood
- Data that changes how they think about a problem
- An answer to a question they've been asking themselves

Nobody unsubscribes from an email that genuinely helped them. They unsubscribe from emails that waste their time.

### Step 4: Set Timing and Conditional Logic

Timing matters more than you think. Too fast and you overwhelm people. Too slow and they forget you exist.

**General timing guidelines:**

- Welcome series: daily for the first 2 emails, then every 2-3 days
- Lead nurture: every 3-5 days
- Abandoned cart: 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours
- Post-purchase: days 0, 3, 7, 14, 30
- Re-engagement: every 3-4 days over two weeks

**Conditional logic to add once your basics are working:**

- If they click a product link → tag them as interested in that product → send product-specific follow-up
- If they open but don't click → try a different subject line angle on the next send
- If they reply to an email → notify your sales team (or yourself) for a personal follow-up
- If they don't open two emails in a row → extend the gap between sends

Start with time-based logic. Add behavior-based logic after you have data.

### Step 5: Test, Measure, Adjust

Send yourself through the full sequence before it goes live. Read every email on your phone. Click every link. Check the timing between emails. Read it out loud. If it sounds like a textbook, rewrite it.

Once it's live, track four numbers:

- **Open rate** (target: 35%+ for drip campaigns)
- **Click rate** (target: 3%+)
- **Reply rate** (often overlooked -- replies signal engagement and improve deliverability)
- **Unsubscribe rate** (under 0.5% per email is healthy)

A/B test subject lines first. They have the biggest single impact on whether your email gets opened. Then test send times. Then email length. One variable at a time.

## Drip Campaign Best Practices That Actually Move the Needle

There's a lot of generic advice floating around. "Personalize your emails." "Write good subject lines." Thanks. Really helpful.

Here's what actually moves metrics:

**Segment by behavior, not just demographics.** What someone *does* tells you more than who they *are*. Did they visit your pricing page twice? Did they open every email but never click? Did they download a specific resource? Segmented campaigns drive [50% more clickthroughs](https://mailchimp.com/resources/email-segmented-campaigns/) than unsegmented ones. Behavior-based segments outperform demographic segments by a wide margin.

**Personalize beyond the first name.** We're past the "{first_name}" era. Real personalization means the content of the email changes based on what someone told you or did. Reference their quiz answers. Mention the specific resource they downloaded. Acknowledge how long they've been on your list. That's what separates a "personalized" email from an email that actually feels personal.

**Write for mobile first.** Over half of all emails get opened on a phone. If your drip emails have wide images, tiny text, or three-column layouts, they're getting deleted. Single column. Big tap targets. Short paragraphs. Preview text that doesn't get cut off.

**Test subject lines like they're headlines.** Your subject line determines whether the email gets opened. Period. A/B test every email in your sequence. We've seen a single subject line change move open rates by 8-12 points. Curiosity gaps, specific numbers, and direct questions tend to beat generic benefit statements.

If you're picking [email automation tools](/blog/email-automation-tools), make sure whatever platform you choose supports conditional branching and behavior tagging. Not all of them do.

## Drip Campaigns vs. Nurture Campaigns: What's the Difference?

These terms get thrown around interchangeably, and it causes confusion. They're related but not the same thing.

**A drip campaign is time-based.** Emails send on a fixed schedule after a trigger event. Day 0, Day 2, Day 5, Day 10. The timing doesn't change based on what the subscriber does between emails.

**A nurture campaign is behavior-responsive.** The next email depends on what the subscriber did with the previous one. Clicked a link? They get email version A. Didn't click? They get version B. Visited the pricing page? Skip ahead to the offer. The sequence adapts in real time.

Here's a quick comparison:

| | Drip Campaign | Nurture Campaign |
|---|---|---|
| **Trigger** | Time-based | Behavior-based |
| **Sequence** | Fixed order | Branching paths |
| **Content** | Same for all subscribers in the segment | Adapts based on actions |
| **Complexity** | Lower (good starting point) | Higher (more effective long-term) |
| **Best for** | Welcome series, onboarding, post-purchase | Lead qualification, sales enablement |

In reality, the best email systems are hybrids. They use time-based scheduling as the backbone and layer behavior-triggered branches on top. That's the approach we use for our quiz funnel email systems -- the base sequence runs on a schedule, but conditional logic routes people into different tracks based on their engagement and quiz answers.

This hybrid approach is also what a solid [lead generation funnel system](/blog/lead-generation-funnel-system) looks like when all the pieces connect. The quiz captures intent. The scoring routes leads. The drip sequences deliver the right content at the right pace for each segment.

## The Intelligence Gap: Why Most Drip Campaigns Fail

Here's the uncomfortable truth about email drip campaigns: most of them underperform not because the emails are bad, but because they treat every lead like the same person.

A CEO researching automation tools for her 50-person team gets the same emails as a freelancer who clicked an ad out of curiosity. A lead who told you their biggest pain point in a quiz gets the same generic nurture sequence as someone who filled out a one-field opt-in form. Same cadence. Same content. Same calls to action.

That's the intelligence gap. Your drip campaign doesn't know anything about the people in it.

**What's missing from most drip setups:**

- **Lead scoring.** Not every subscriber is equally likely to buy. Some are ready now. Some are months away. Without scoring, you can't prioritize.
- **Temperature routing.** Hot leads need a fast-track path to a conversation. Cool leads need education. Putting them in the same sequence guarantees you'll either scare off the cool leads or bore the hot ones.
- **Behavior-triggered branching.** What happens when someone clicks your pricing link in email three? In most drip campaigns, nothing. They get email four on schedule like everyone else. That's a missed signal.
- **Answer-aware content.** If someone told you (via a quiz, intake form, or survey) exactly what they're struggling with, and you send them an email that doesn't reference that answer -- you've wasted the most valuable data you had.

We'll be honest: this is the problem we built our entire business around. Quiz funnels that capture real data about each lead, score them, route them into the right track, and then deliver 26 behavior-triggered emails where the content actually changes based on what that person told you. It's not magic. It's just using the data you already collected.

The difference between a generic five-email drip and a behavior-triggered system is the difference between shouting into a crowd and having individual conversations. Both take effort to set up. One produces dramatically better results.

## Email Drip Campaign FAQ

**What is a drip email campaign?**

A drip email campaign is an automated sequence of emails sent on a pre-set schedule after someone takes a specific action -- like signing up for your list, making a purchase, or abandoning their cart. Each email in the sequence builds on the last, guiding the subscriber toward a goal (usually a purchase, booking, or deeper engagement). The key feature: you build it once, and it runs automatically for every new subscriber.

**How many emails should be in a drip campaign?**

It depends on the goal. Welcome sequences typically run 4-5 emails over 7-10 days. Lead nurture drips run 6-8 emails over 30-45 days. Abandoned cart recovery uses 4 emails over 72 hours. Re-engagement drips use 4 emails over two weeks. There's no universal number, but our general rule is: keep sending as long as each email earns its place. If an email doesn't have a clear job, cut it.

**What is an example of a drip campaign?**

The most common example is a welcome email series. Someone signs up for a free resource on your website. They immediately get an email with the download link. Two days later, they get a follow-up asking about their biggest challenge. Three days after that, they get a mini case study. Then a teaching email. Then an introduction to your paid service. Five emails, zero manual effort, running 24/7 for every new subscriber.

**What is the 60/40 rule in email?**

The 60/40 rule says 60% of your emails should deliver value (education, stories, helpful content) and 40% can promote your offer. Some marketers push this to 80/20 for drip campaigns specifically, and that's closer to what we'd recommend. In our experience, the more generous you are early in the sequence, the less resistance you face when you do make the offer. Front-load value. Earn the right to sell.

**How do I start an email drip campaign?**

Pick one campaign type. We recommend starting with a welcome series because it applies to every business and has the highest impact per email. Choose your email platform (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign -- any of them work for basic drips). Write 4-5 emails following the structure in this guide. Set the trigger (new subscriber) and timing (days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7). Send yourself through the full sequence to test it. Then turn it on. You can add complexity -- scoring, branching, conditional logic -- later. Get the basics live first.
