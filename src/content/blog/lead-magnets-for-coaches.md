Most coaches we talk to have the same lead magnet: a PDF guide nobody reads.

Maybe it's "10 Steps to Transform Your Life" or "The Ultimate Guide to Building Confidence." It sits behind an opt-in form, collects some email addresses, and then... nothing much happens. Open rates drop. Leads go cold. The coach goes back to posting on Instagram and hoping the algorithm cooperates.

Here's the problem. Lead magnets for coaches need to do something that generic PDFs don't: they need to start a conversation. Your entire business runs on understanding people. Your lead magnet should do the same thing. It should learn something about the person downloading it, give them a quick win, and make the next step obvious.

We ranked 15 lead magnet ideas by how well they convert for coaching businesses specifically. Not marketing agencies. Not SaaS companies. Coaches. Some of these are dead simple to create. Others take real work. All of them beat "subscribe to my newsletter."

## The 15 lead magnets for coaches, ranked

Here's the quick version before we break each one down:

| Rank | Lead magnet | Expected conversion rate |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Self-assessment quiz | 30-45% |
| 2 | Readiness scorecard | 25-40% |
| 3 | Personalized action plan generator | 25-35% |
| 4 | Strategy session qualifier | 20-30% |
| 5 | Mini-course (3-5 days) | 18-28% |
| 6 | Client intake template | 15-22% |
| 7 | Session planning framework | 14-20% |
| 8 | Pricing calculator | 13-20% |
| 9 | Goal-setting workbook | 12-18% |
| 10 | Anonymized case study collection | 11-17% |
| 11 | Industry benchmark report | 10-15% |
| 12 | Done-for-you email scripts | 9-14% |
| 13 | Checklist | 8-13% |
| 14 | eBook or guide | 5-10% |
| 15 | Resource list | 4-8% |

The gap between #1 and #15 is massive. A self-assessment quiz can convert 6x better than a resource list. That should tell you something about what your audience actually wants.

## Tier 1: The highest-converting lead magnets for coaches

These five formats consistently outperform everything else. They share one trait: they give prospects something personalized.

### 1. Self-assessment quiz

**Expected conversion: 30-45%**

A self-assessment quiz asks prospects 5-8 questions about their current situation and delivers a personalized result. For coaching businesses, this format is hard to beat because it mirrors what you actually do in discovery calls.

The reason quizzes convert so well for coaches is that your prospects are already asking themselves questions. "Am I ready for a career change?" "Is my business actually stuck or am I just tired?" A quiz gives them a structured way to find out.

**Example**: A career coach creates "What's your career confidence score?" with questions about job satisfaction, salary comfort, growth opportunities, and interview readiness. Each person gets a score out of 100 with a breakdown of their weakest area. The follow-up emails address that specific weakness.

The real power is what happens after. Quiz answers tell you whether someone is browsing casually or actively looking for help. You can tag leads as hot, warm, or cold based on their responses and send completely different email sequences to each group. That means you stop wasting discovery calls on people who aren't ready.

We've seen coaching quiz funnels [outperform PDF lead magnets by 2-3x](/blog/quiz-funnels-vs-pdf-lead-magnets) on opt-in rate alone. When you factor in lead quality, the difference is even bigger.

### 2. Readiness scorecard

**Expected conversion: 25-40%**

Similar to a quiz but focused on one question: "Am I ready?" This works particularly well for coaches because most prospects are stuck between wanting change and actually committing to it.

A readiness scorecard gives them an honest answer. And honesty builds trust fast.

**Example**: A health coach builds a "Body transformation readiness score" that evaluates five areas: nutrition habits, exercise consistency, sleep quality, stress management, and accountability systems. Prospects answer 10 questions and get a score from 1-100 with a tier label: "Not Yet Ready," "Almost There," or "Ready to Go." Each tier gets different follow-up content. The "Not Yet Ready" group gets mindset content. The "Ready to Go" group gets a call booking link.

The scorecard format works because people want to know where they stand. It taps into the same psychology that makes personality tests shareable. But unlike a BuzzFeed quiz, your scorecard positions you as the expert who can help them move from their current score to where they want to be.

### 3. Personalized action plan generator

**Expected conversion: 25-35%**

This one takes more work to build but delivers enormous value. Ask 5-7 questions about someone's goals, current situation, and biggest obstacles. Then generate a custom action plan based on their answers.

The key word is "personalized." A generic action plan is just another PDF. A plan that references their specific answers feels like a $200 strategy session they got for free.

**Example**: A business coach creates "Your 90-day growth plan" that asks about revenue targets, team size, current marketing channels, biggest bottleneck, and available hours per week. The output is a prioritized list of three actions for the next 90 days, tailored to their answers. A solopreneur at $5K/month gets different recommendations than a team of four at $30K/month.

Building this requires some conditional logic. You'll need a tool or platform that can map different answer combinations to different outputs. It's not something you throw together in Canva over lunch. But the conversion rates reflect the effort.

### 4. Strategy session qualifier

**Expected conversion: 20-30%**

This is a lead magnet and a booking filter rolled into one. Instead of offering a "free strategy session" to anyone with a pulse, you position the session as something people apply for. The application itself is the lead magnet.

Prospects fill out a short questionnaire about their business, goals, and what they've already tried. Everyone who completes it gets a useful resource (a benchmark comparison, a quick-win recommendation, something valuable). Qualified applicants also get invited to book a call.

**Example**: A leadership coach offers "Apply for a complimentary leadership audit." The 8-question application covers team size, biggest management challenge, previous coaching experience, and budget range. Everyone gets a one-page "leadership style snapshot" after completing it. Prospects who match the coach's ideal client criteria get a personalized email inviting them to book a 30-minute audit call.

This format is self-selecting. People who take time to fill out an application are more serious than people who downloaded a PDF while half-watching Netflix. Your show-up rate for calls will be noticeably higher.

### 5. Mini-course (3-5 days)

**Expected conversion: 18-28%**

A short email course delivered over 3-5 days. Each email teaches one concept and includes a small action step. By day five, the prospect has built real momentum and you've built real trust.

Mini-courses work for coaches because they demonstrate your teaching style. A prospect who completes your free course already knows what working with you feels like. That removes a huge objection from the sales conversation.

**Example**: A life coach creates "5 Days to Better Boundaries" where each day covers one boundary-setting scenario: Day 1 is work boundaries, Day 2 is family, Day 3 is friendships, Day 4 is digital/social media, Day 5 is self-boundaries. Each email is 400-500 words with one exercise. The final email invites them to a paid workshop or 1:1 coaching.

One thing to know: mini-courses have lower initial opt-in rates than quizzes because they require a time commitment upfront. But the leads who do sign up tend to be higher quality. They've already said yes to showing up for five days straight. That's a signal.

## Tier 2: Solid performers that build authority

These five won't blow up your conversion rates overnight, but they attract serious prospects. If you already have steady traffic and want to build a library of lead magnets for different stages of the buyer journey, Tier 2 is where to look.

### 6. Client intake template

**Expected conversion: 15-22%**

If you coach other coaches or consultants, this is gold. A ready-to-use intake form template that they can copy and customize for their own clients. It saves them hours and positions you as someone who understands the operational side of coaching.

A career coach could offer "The client discovery questionnaire template (20 questions that reveal what your client actually needs)." Business coaches could share the exact onboarding form they use with their own clients.

### 7. Session planning framework

**Expected conversion: 14-20%**

A structured template for planning coaching sessions. This works for coaches who serve other coaches (coach-the-coach model) and for any niche where prospects want a taste of your methodology.

Think of it as a peek behind the curtain. You're giving away your session structure, which seems generous but actually makes people want the full experience. Reading a recipe and eating at the restaurant are two different things.

A relationship coach could offer "The couples session blueprint: the 4-phase conversation framework we use in every session." Include the structure, sample questions for each phase, and timing guidelines.

### 8. Pricing calculator

**Expected conversion: 13-20%**

This works best for business coaches and consultants who help clients set their own prices. The calculator asks about experience, market, deliverables, and overhead, then suggests a price range.

It works because pricing is one of the most emotionally charged decisions in business. People will hand over their email in a heartbeat if it means getting clarity on what to charge. A financial coach could create "What should you charge? The freelance rate calculator" that factors in expenses, desired income, available hours, and market positioning.

The interactive format matters here. A static "pricing guide" PDF converts around 6-8%. A calculator that gives personalized results based on their inputs converts 13-20%. Same topic, dramatically different engagement.

### 9. Goal-setting workbook

**Expected conversion: 12-18%**

A fillable workbook that walks someone through setting meaningful goals. Not "write down your dreams" motivational fluff. A structured process with specific prompts, timelines, and accountability checkpoints.

This performs best around January and September (New Year and back-to-school energy). A wellness coach could release "The 12-week wellness reset workbook" with weekly check-in templates, habit trackers, and a self-assessment at the start and end. Make it printable. Coaches' audiences still love printing things out.

### 10. Anonymized case study collection

**Expected conversion: 11-17%**

Three to five real client stories showing before, during, and after working with you. Change the names. Keep the specifics.

This is proof. Not a testimonial quote on your sales page. Real narratives with real numbers and real timelines. "Sarah came to us stuck at $4K/month with three clients. Four months later, she had eight clients and was billing $11K." That story does more selling than any PDF guide.

A business coach could compile "5 coaching clients who doubled their revenue in 6 months (and how they did it)." Include the starting point, the specific changes made, the timeline, and the outcome. The more specific, the more believable.

## Tier 3: Good starters when you need something fast

These are the quickest to create. They won't convert as well as Tier 1 or 2, but if you need a lead magnet by Friday, start here. You can always upgrade later.

### 11. Industry benchmark report

**Expected conversion: 10-15%**

Original data about your niche. Average coaching rates, client retention numbers, session frequency data, revenue benchmarks by experience level. If you can survey your audience or pull together data from your own clients (anonymized), this becomes a valuable reference people bookmark.

A fitness coaching business could produce "2026 online fitness coaching benchmarks: rates, retention, and revenue by niche" based on a survey of 100+ coaches. The data itself becomes shareable and can drive organic backlinks too.

This takes more effort than a checklist, but the payoff is that benchmark reports position you as a thought leader. They also give you an excuse to email your list every year with updated numbers.

### 12. Done-for-you email scripts

**Expected conversion: 9-14%**

Copy-paste email templates for specific scenarios. Following up after a discovery call. Re-engaging a cold lead. Asking for a referral. Raising your prices. Coaches love these because writing emails feels like pulling teeth for most of them.

"7 email scripts every coach needs: from first contact to referral request." Make them specific enough to use immediately but general enough to work across niches. Include the subject line, the body, and a note explaining why each email works.

### 13. Checklist

**Expected conversion: 8-13%**

The classic lead magnet. Fast to create, easy to consume. "The pre-launch checklist for your first group coaching program" or "Coaching session prep: 12 things to do before every client call."

Checklists work when they're extremely specific. "How to grow your coaching business" is a topic, not a checklist. "27-point website audit for coaches who want more inbound leads" is a checklist someone will actually use.

Keep it to one or two pages. The moment it feels like homework, you've lost the appeal.

### 14. eBook or guide

**Expected conversion: 5-10%**

The most common lead magnet on the internet, which is exactly why it underperforms. Everyone has an eBook. Most of them sit unread in people's downloads folders.

That said, a well-written guide on a specific topic can still work if the topic is narrow enough. "The complete guide to coaching" won't turn heads. "How to run your first paid workshop as a life coach (even if you've never done one)" might.

If you go this route, keep it under 15 pages. Add visual examples. Include a worksheet or template inside. Give people a reason to open it more than once. Want a deeper look at how [lead magnets fit into a complete funnel](/blog/lead-magnet-funnels-complete-guide)? That link covers the full picture.

### 15. Resource list

**Expected conversion: 4-8%**

A curated list of tools, books, podcasts, or other resources. "The 25 tools I use to run my coaching business" or "My 10 favorite books for new coaches."

Honest assessment: this is the weakest lead magnet format on the list. It's easy to put together, which means everyone has one. The value is low because people can Google most of it. And there's no personalization or interaction.

Use a resource list as a bonus inside another lead magnet, not as your primary offer. If it's all you have right now, it's better than nothing. But plan to upgrade to Tier 1 or 2 as soon as you can.

## How to pick the right lead magnet for your coaching business

Fifteen options is a lot. Here's how to narrow it down.

**If you're just starting out** and have limited traffic (under 500 monthly visitors), go with a Tier 3 option to get something live fast. A specific checklist or a short guide takes a weekend to create. You can test your messaging and start collecting emails while you build something better.

**If you have an audience but poor conversion**, jump straight to Tier 1. You already have the traffic. The problem is that your current lead magnet isn't compelling enough. A self-assessment quiz or readiness scorecard will dramatically change your numbers. If you're not sure what a lead magnet should do in the first place, our post on [what a lead magnet is](/blog/what-is-a-lead-magnet) covers the fundamentals.

**If you're booking discovery calls but they're unqualified**, the strategy session qualifier (#4) solves that directly. It filters out people who aren't ready before they get on your calendar.

**Match the format to your niche**. Career and business coaches tend to see the best results with quizzes and scorecards because their prospects are actively evaluating whether to make a change. Health and wellness coaches do well with readiness scorecards and mini-courses because behavior change requires building momentum. Life coaches benefit from personalized action plans because their audience is looking for direction.

**Think about what comes after**. The best lead magnet isn't the one that collects the most emails. It's the one that collects emails from people who are likely to become clients. A quiz that tags and scores leads gives you more to work with than a PDF that treats every subscriber the same.

## FAQ

**How long should it take to create a coaching lead magnet?**

Depends on the format. A checklist or resource list can be done in an afternoon. A self-assessment quiz with scoring logic, personalized results, and automated email follow-up takes 2-4 weeks if you're doing it yourself. If you want [the full system built for you](/what-you-get), that's what we do.

**Can I have more than one lead magnet?**

Yes. In fact, you should. Different lead magnets attract people at different stages. A checklist captures people who are browsing. A readiness scorecard captures people who are closer to buying. Use Tier 3 as entry points on blog posts and social. Put Tier 1 on your homepage and paid ads.

**What platform should I use to build a quiz funnel?**

You've got options. Typeform and Interact are popular for DIY. If you want a custom-built quiz with lead scoring, personalized results pages, and automated email sequences baked in, that's the kind of system we build at Brothers Automate.

**How do I promote my lead magnet once it's live?**

Put it everywhere. Homepage banner, blog sidebar, exit-intent popup, Instagram bio link, end of every podcast episode, email signature. The lead magnet only works if people see it. Most coaches create a great lead magnet and then mention it once on social media. That's not a promotion strategy.

**What conversion rate should I expect?**

For coaches specifically, a well-built quiz funnel converts between 30-45% of landing page visitors. A solid checklist or guide lands around 8-12%. Anything below 5% means either your offer isn't compelling, your landing page copy needs work, or you're sending the wrong traffic.
