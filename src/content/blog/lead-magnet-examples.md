Not all lead magnets perform the same. A quiz funnel can convert 30-50% of the people who start it. A generic PDF ebook? You're looking at 1-5% on a good day. The format you pick determines whether your lead generation actually works or just feels productive.

We put together 27 lead magnet examples and ranked them by real conversion data -- from the formats that consistently pull 40%+ down to the ones that barely crack single digits. Each example includes what it is, who it works for, a concrete title you could steal, and the conversion range we've seen across clients and industry benchmarks.

The pattern is obvious once you see it laid out. The more interactive and personalized the lead magnet, the higher it converts. Static downloads sit at the bottom. Anything that gives people a result based on *their* answers sits at the top.

Here's the full breakdown. If you want the quick version, start with the benchmark table below and then jump to whichever tier fits your budget and timeline.

## Conversion rate benchmarks at a glance

| Tier | Conversion range | Format type | Examples |
|------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| **A** | 25-50%+ | Interactive & personalized | Quizzes, assessments, scorecards, calculators |
| **B** | 10-25% | High-value static & semi-interactive | Mini-courses, templates, swipe files, challenges |
| **C** | 1-10% | Passive downloads | Ebooks, guides, whitepapers, newsletters, discount codes |

The gap between Tier A and Tier C is not incremental. It's 5-10x. That doesn't mean Tier C is useless -- some businesses start there and do fine. But if you're spending money on ads, that gap is the difference between profitable and burning cash.

---

## Tier A: 25-50%+ conversion rate (lead magnet examples 1-7)

These are the lead magnet examples that consistently outperform everything else. They share one trait: the person gets something back that's specific to *them*. Not a generic file. A personalized result, score, or recommendation.

### 1. Interactive quiz funnel

**Conversion: 30-50% | Best for: coaches, consultants, e-commerce, course creators**

A 5-7 question quiz that sorts people into result categories based on their answers. Behind the scenes, each answer carries a score that tags the lead as hot, warm, or cold. The result page is personalized. The email follow-up is personalized. Everything after the quiz is tailored to what the person actually told you.

**Example title**: "What's your client acquisition style?" (for a business coach)

This is the format we build most often, and it's at the top of the list for a reason. Quiz funnels don't just capture more emails -- they capture better data. After someone finishes, you know their biggest pain point, how ready they are to buy, and what kind of messaging will resonate. A [PDF lead magnet gives you a name and email](/blog/quiz-funnels-vs-pdf-lead-magnets). A quiz gives you a full lead profile.

The psychology is straightforward: people start because they're curious about their result, and they finish because they've already invested time answering questions. Abandoning at question six feels like wasting the effort they put into questions one through five.

### 2. Self-assessment scorecard

**Conversion: 25-40% | Best for: coaches, consultants, B2B services**

Similar to a quiz but focused on a single metric. "How ready are you for X?" The output is a score -- usually out of 100 -- with a breakdown of what's strong and what needs work.

**Example title**: "What's your automation readiness score?" (for a marketing agency targeting small businesses)

Scorecards work because people love benchmarking themselves. The score creates an immediate emotional reaction. A 34 out of 100 stings. It also creates a natural next step: "Want help improving that score?" The format is especially strong in B2B where buyers need to justify decisions with data.

### 3. Personalized recommendation engine

**Conversion: 30-45% | Best for: e-commerce, SaaS, product-based businesses**

Ask a few questions about preferences, needs, or situation. Recommend specific products or solutions based on the answers. E-commerce brands use these as "product finders" and they consistently convert at 2-3x the rate of static category pages.

**Example title**: "Find your perfect skincare routine" (for a DTC beauty brand)

Sephora, Dollar Shave Club, and hundreds of smaller brands run this format because it works for a simple reason: instead of making the customer browse 200 products, you hand them the three that actually fit. That curation feels like a service, not a marketing tactic.

### 4. ROI or savings calculator

**Conversion: 25-35% | Best for: SaaS, financial services, B2B, consultants**

Let people plug in their own numbers and see a result. How much could they save? What's their potential ROI? What should they charge? The inputs are specific to their business, so the output feels custom.

**Example title**: "How much revenue are you losing to unqualified leads?" (for a sales consulting firm)

Calculators convert well because the output has a dollar sign on it. That's inherently more interesting than a PDF. HubSpot's website grader is a famous example -- it's a calculator disguised as a tool, and it generated millions of leads over the years. You don't need to be HubSpot to pull this off. A simple spreadsheet-style calculator behind an email gate works.

### 5. Diagnostic tool or audit

**Conversion: 25-40% | Best for: agencies, consultants, SaaS**

An automated version of the discovery call. The user answers questions about their current setup and receives a diagnostic report highlighting gaps, risks, or opportunities. It positions you as the expert without requiring any of your time.

**Example title**: "Free SEO audit: find out what's holding your site back" (for a digital marketing agency)

The word "audit" carries weight in B2B. It implies professional-grade analysis. The trick is delivering genuine value in the results -- not a teaser that says "you have problems, pay us to find out what they are." Show them two or three real findings for free. That builds enough trust to start a sales conversation.

### 6. Product recommendation quiz (e-commerce)

**Conversion: 28-42% | Best for: e-commerce, DTC brands, subscription businesses**

A shorter, more visual version of the recommendation engine specifically built for shopping. Typically 3-5 questions with image-based answer options. The result page shows specific products with add-to-cart buttons.

**Example title**: "Build your custom coffee subscription" (for a specialty coffee brand)

This differs from #3 because it's designed for immediate purchase rather than lead nurture. Some brands use it as a lead magnet (email required for results), others skip the email gate entirely and use it as a conversion tool on the product page. Either way, the data on what people select is gold for inventory planning and ad targeting.

### 7. Free consultation with a qualifier quiz

**Conversion: 20-35% | Best for: high-ticket services, coaches, agencies**

Instead of a generic "book a free call" button, you add a 4-6 question qualifier before the booking page. Everyone who completes the quiz gets something useful -- a quick tip, a benchmark comparison, a resource. But only qualified leads see the calendar link.

**Example title**: "Apply for a free growth audit (3-minute qualifier)" (for a business growth consultant)

This format solves the biggest complaint we hear from coaches and consultants: "I'm doing too many calls with people who can't afford my services." The quiz filters before the call, not during it. One client told us their close rate went from 18% to 43% after switching to this format because every call was with someone who'd already self-identified as ready to invest.

---

## Tier B: 10-25% conversion rate (lead magnet examples 8-16)

These lead magnet examples require more effort from the prospect -- watching, reading, or doing something over multiple days. They convert lower than Tier A, but the leads tend to be serious. Someone who completes a 5-day email course is more committed than someone who clicked a quiz on impulse.

### 8. Mini-course (email or video)

**Conversion: 18-28% | Best for: course creators, coaches, educators**

A 3-5 day course delivered via email or unlockable video lessons. Each day covers one concept and includes an action step. By the end, the person has built momentum and experienced your teaching style firsthand.

**Example title**: "5 Days to Your First Freelance Client" (for a freelancing coach)

Mini-courses convert well because the perceived value is high. "Free course" sounds expensive. The people who sign up are self-selecting for seriousness. The downside is that completion rates for the full course hover around 30-40%, so your day-5 CTA will only reach a fraction of signups.

### 9. Template pack

**Conversion: 15-25% | Best for: any B2B, freelancers, agencies, consultants**

Ready-to-use templates that save real time. Email templates, proposal formats, SOPs, project plans, social media calendars. The more specific, the better the conversion.

**Example title**: "The $10K proposal template (the exact format that closed our last 4 clients)" (for a freelance consultant)

Templates work because they eliminate the blank-page problem. Nobody wants to write a proposal from scratch at 9pm. They want to fill in the blanks on something that already works. The best template packs include 3-5 templates, not 50. More options creates more friction.

### 10. Swipe file

**Conversion: 12-22% | Best for: marketers, copywriters, creative professionals**

A curated collection of real examples. Best-performing subject lines, ad copy that generated results, landing pages that convert, cold email sequences that got replies. Swipe files promise one thing: "Don't start from scratch."

**Example title**: "37 Facebook ad hooks that generated 6-figure campaigns" (for an ad agency)

The conversion range is wide here because quality varies enormously. A swipe file of five generic examples converts at 12%. A swipe file of 30+ real examples with performance data and annotations converts at 20%+. If you're going to do a swipe file, go deep.

### 11. Spreadsheet tool

**Conversion: 14-22% | Best for: finance, operations, marketing, project management**

A pre-built Google Sheet or Excel template with formulas, conditional formatting, and instructions. Content budget planners, client tracking systems, financial models, editorial calendars.

**Example title**: "The content ROI tracker (plug in your numbers, see what's working)" (for a content marketing agency)

Spreadsheets don't sound sexy. They convert anyway. The reason is utility -- people use them repeatedly, which keeps your brand in front of them every week. A PDF gets opened once. A spreadsheet becomes part of their workflow.

### 12. Video training

**Conversion: 12-20% | Best for: coaches, course creators, SaaS onboarding**

A single 15-45 minute training video that teaches something specific. Not a recorded webinar. A focused, edited video that delivers one outcome.

**Example title**: "How to write a landing page in 30 minutes (live walkthrough)" (for a copywriting coach)

Video converts less than interactive formats but builds personal connection faster than anything else on this list. If your business depends on people trusting *you* specifically -- as with coaching or consulting -- a well-produced training video can be more effective than a higher-converting quiz for your specific situation.

### 13. Challenge (5-7 days)

**Conversion: 15-25% | Best for: fitness, coaching, course creators, community-driven businesses**

A structured multi-day challenge with daily tasks, often paired with a Facebook group or community element. "7-Day Declutter Challenge," "5-Day Content Creation Sprint," that sort of thing.

**Example title**: "The 5-Day $1K Challenge: make your first $1,000 from your expertise" (for a monetization coach)

Challenges convert well on signup because they feel like an event. There's a start date, a community, and a deadline. The constraint creates urgency. But be honest about the workload -- challenges require daily promotion, community management, and follow-up. They're closer to running a launch than setting up a lead magnet.

### 14. Webinar (live or recorded)

**Conversion: 10-20% registration, 30-45% of registrants attend | Best for: SaaS, B2B, coaches, consultants**

A 45-60 minute presentation on a specific topic. Live webinars convert better than recorded ones because of urgency and interaction.

**Example title**: "The 3 automations that save our clients 10 hours per week" (for a business automation agency)

Webinars are the workhorse of B2B lead generation for a reason. They give you 45 minutes of attention, which is orders of magnitude more than a PDF gets. The catch is that attendance rates are declining year over year. In 2020, 40-50% of registrants showed up. In 2026, that number is closer to 25-35%. Plan accordingly and always have a replay strategy.

### 15. Checklist

**Conversion: 10-18% | Best for: any niche, especially process-heavy industries**

A step-by-step list for completing a specific task. Launch checklists, audit checklists, setup checklists. Short, scannable, and immediately actionable.

**Example title**: "The 43-point Shopify store launch checklist" (for an e-commerce consultant)

Checklists are the most underrated format on this list. They don't generate excitement, but they quietly perform because the promise is clear and the commitment is low. The key is specificity. "Marketing checklist" converts poorly. "Pre-launch checklist for your first info product" converts well. Numbers in the title help too. [Not sure what a lead magnet should do for your business?](/blog/what-is-a-lead-magnet) Start with the basics.

### 16. Workbook

**Conversion: 10-16% | Best for: coaches, educators, personal development**

A fillable document that walks someone through a process. More interactive than a guide, more structured than a worksheet. Usually 5-15 pages with prompts, exercises, and space to write.

**Example title**: "The quarterly business planning workbook" (for a business strategist)

Workbooks land in the middle because they require effort. The people who actually fill them out become strong leads. The people who download and never open them (probably half) become dead weight on your list. If you go this route, consider sending a "Did you start your workbook?" reminder email on day 3 to boost engagement.

## Tier C: 1-10% conversion rate (lead magnet examples 17-27)

These are the most common lead magnet examples on the internet, which is part of why they underperform. Familiarity breeds indifference. That said, they're fast to create, and some niches still respond to them.

### 17. Ebook

**Conversion: 5-10% | Best for: thought leadership, B2B, established brands**

A 10-30 page PDF covering a topic in depth. This was the gold standard lead magnet in 2015. It's not 2015 anymore.

**Example title**: "The small business owner's guide to marketing automation" (for a marketing software company)

Ebooks still work when the topic is extremely specific and the author has genuine credibility. A generic "Ultimate Guide to Digital Marketing" ebook from a company nobody's heard of will sit at 2-3%. An ebook from a recognized expert on a narrow topic can hit 8-10%. If you're not a known name, skip this format and go interactive.

### 18. Whitepaper

**Conversion: 4-8% | Best for: B2B enterprise, technical audiences, SaaS**

A research-backed document that explores a specific problem or trend. Heavier than an ebook, more formal in tone.

**Example title**: "2026 state of AI adoption in mid-market companies" (for an enterprise software vendor)

Whitepapers convert low but attract high-value leads. The person downloading a whitepaper at 2pm on a Tuesday is probably a decision-maker doing research. One good whitepaper lead might be worth 50 ebook leads in terms of deal size. If you sell to enterprises, this format still has a place.

### 19. Industry report

**Conversion: 5-9% | Best for: SaaS, agencies, media companies, consultants**

Original research packaged as a downloadable report. Survey data, benchmark data, trend analysis.

**Example title**: "2026 email marketing benchmarks: open rates, click rates, and revenue by industry" (for an email marketing platform)

Reports take real effort to produce. You need data. But they generate backlinks, social shares, and press mentions that other formats don't. If you can survey your audience or pull data from your own platform, a yearly report becomes a recurring lead generation and brand-building asset.

### 20. Resource list or toolkit

**Conversion: 4-8% | Best for: beginners, niche communities**

A curated list of tools, apps, books, or resources for a specific task or role.

**Example title**: "The solopreneur's tech stack: 12 tools we actually use (and what we pay)" (for a productivity consultant)

We're being honest: this is one of the weakest lead magnet formats. Most of the information is available through a quick search. The perceived value is low. Use it as a bonus *inside* another lead magnet, not as your primary offer.

### 21. Case study (standalone PDF)

**Conversion: 3-7% | Best for: agencies, B2B services, SaaS**

A detailed breakdown of a client result. Before, during, and after with specific numbers.

**Example title**: "How we generated 847 qualified leads in 60 days for a SaaS startup" (for a lead gen agency)

Case studies convert poorly as standalone lead magnets because people don't wake up thinking "I want to download a case study today." But they're extremely effective *within* a funnel -- as a follow-up email to warm leads who need social proof. Build your case studies, but gate them inside your nurture sequence rather than using them as the front door.

### 22. Infographic

**Conversion: 3-6% | Best for: data-heavy topics, social-first audiences**

A visual representation of data, processes, or comparisons.

**Example title**: "The anatomy of a $100K launch (visual breakdown)" (for a launch strategist)

Infographics were a massive lead gen format around 2013-2016. They've declined since then because social platforms don't reward the format like they used to. If your audience is still on Pinterest or if your niche is extremely visual, infographics can work. For most businesses, there are better options.

### 23. Newsletter signup

**Conversion: 1-5% | Best for: media companies, content creators with established audiences**

"Subscribe to our newsletter" as the lead magnet. No free resource, just the promise of future content.

**Example title**: "Get our weekly marketing breakdown every Tuesday" (for a marketing content brand)

Newsletter-only opt-ins convert at the bottom of the range for a reason: there's no immediate payoff. The promise is future value, and most people don't trust that from a brand they just discovered. Exception: if you're already well-known (like Morning Brew or The Hustle were when they grew), the brand *is* the lead magnet. For everyone else, pair your newsletter with an actual resource.

### 24. Discount code or coupon

**Conversion: 3-8% | Best for: e-commerce, DTC brands, retail**

"Sign up for 10% off your first order." The most common e-commerce lead magnet.

**Example title**: "Get 15% off + free shipping on your first order" (for a DTC apparel brand)

Discount codes convert okay on first purchase but create a specific problem: they attract deal-seekers who may never buy at full price. Your list fills up with people waiting for the next sale. If you use this format, pair it with a product recommendation quiz (see #6) to at least capture preference data alongside the email.

### 25. Free trial

**Conversion: 2-8% signup, varies widely on activation | Best for: SaaS, software, membership sites**

Access to your product for a limited time.

**Example title**: "Start your 14-day free trial (no credit card required)" (for a project management SaaS)

Free trials aren't traditional lead magnets, but they function as one. The conversion rate depends almost entirely on how frictionless the signup is and how fast users experience the product's value. "No credit card required" nearly doubles signup rates compared to trials that require payment info upfront.

### 26. Email course (long-form)

**Conversion: 3-7% | Best for: educators, complex topics, patient audiences**

A multi-week email series covering a topic in depth. 10-20 emails over 3-6 weeks.

**Example title**: "Marketing fundamentals: a 4-week email course for founders" (for a marketing education company)

Long-form email courses sit lower than mini-courses (#8) because the time commitment scares people off at signup. "4 weeks" sounds like homework. The leads who do sign up are highly qualified, but you'll get far fewer of them. If you want the email-course format, keep it to 5 days. If your content genuinely needs 4 weeks, break it into a 5-day intro course and a paid upgrade to the full thing.

### 27. Generic PDF guide

**Conversion: 1-5% | Best for: honestly, very few situations in 2026**

The "Ultimate Guide to [Topic]" PDF that every business created between 2014 and 2020. Twenty pages of content that could be a blog post.

**Example title**: "The complete guide to social media marketing" (for... anyone, apparently)

We put this last because it deserves to be last. Generic PDF guides were effective a decade ago when fewer businesses were doing content marketing. Now every search result leads to a page offering a free guide. The format is played out. If you absolutely have to create a PDF, make it absurdly specific and give it a concrete promise: "The exact 3-email sequence that booked 14 sales calls in January" beats "The Email Marketing Guide" every time.

## Why interactive lead magnet examples outperform static ones

Look at the list again. The top seven are all interactive. The bottom eleven are all static. That's not a coincidence.

Three things explain the gap.

**Personalization creates value.** A generic PDF delivers the same content to everyone. A quiz delivers a result specific to *your* answers. Same topic, completely different perceived value. When the output changes based on the input, people pay attention. They also share it more -- "I got this result, what did you get?" drives organic reach in a way that "I downloaded this PDF" never will.

**Investment psychology works in your favor.** The minute someone starts answering questions or plugging numbers into a calculator, they've committed time and attention. Psychologists call this the sunk cost effect. By question four of a quiz, people want their result badly enough to hand over an email. Compare that to a landing page that asks for an email before delivering anything. One feels like a fair trade. The other feels like a toll booth.

**Data compounds over time.** Here's what most "best lead magnet examples" posts won't tell you: the biggest advantage of interactive formats isn't the higher conversion rate. It's the data. After 500 people complete your quiz, you know exactly what your market struggles with, which segments are ready to buy, and what language they use to describe their problems. That data improves your ads, your sales calls, your content, and your product. A PDF gives you an email list. A [quiz funnel gives you market intelligence](/blog/how-quiz-funnels-generate-qualified-leads).

Static formats still have a role. Templates, checklists, and swipe files are genuinely useful. But they work better as mid-funnel resources -- things you send to leads who've already entered your world through an interactive front door.

## How to pick the right lead magnet for your business

The right format depends on three things: your business model, your audience, and what you're willing to build.

**If you sell high-ticket services ($1,000+)**, go straight to Tier A. A quiz funnel or assessment lets you qualify leads before you ever get on a call. The [time and money savings from avoiding unqualified calls](/blog/quiz-funnels-vs-pdf-lead-magnets) usually pays for the lead magnet build within the first month or two. If you want to see how all the pieces connect downstream, our [guide to lead magnet funnels](/blog/lead-magnet-funnels-complete-guide) covers the full system.

**If you run an e-commerce brand**, a product recommendation quiz (#3 or #6) will outperform a discount code almost every time. It converts higher *and* gives you data about what customers want. Pair it with a discount as a bonus -- "Get your personalized recommendations + 10% off" -- and you get the best of both formats.

**If you're a coach or course creator**, self-assessment quizzes and mini-courses are your strongest options. Both formats mirror the experience of working with you, which makes the sale downstream feel like a natural next step. We wrote a whole post on [lead magnets for coaches](/blog/lead-magnets-for-coaches) if you want specific ideas for that niche.

**If you're in SaaS or B2B**, calculators and diagnostic tools fit your buyers' decision-making process. B2B buyers want data, not feelings. A "how much is this problem costing you?" calculator speaks their language.

**If you have zero budget and need something by Friday**, grab a Tier B or C format. A checklist or template pack takes a weekend to build. Get it live, start collecting emails, and upgrade to an interactive format once you've validated your offer and have traffic to work with.

One more thing: you can stack formats. Use a quiz as your primary lead magnet for ads and your homepage. Use a checklist as the opt-in on blog posts. Use a case study pack inside your email nurture sequence. Different stages of the buyer journey call for different formats.

## Frequently asked questions

**What's the highest-converting lead magnet format overall?**

Interactive quizzes and assessments. Across industries, quiz funnels convert at 30-50% of visitors who start them. That's 5-10x higher than static formats. The conversion advantage comes from curiosity (people want their result), micro-commitment psychology (they've already invested time), and personalization (the output feels custom). If you can only build one lead magnet, make it interactive.

**Do these conversion rates apply to my industry?**

The ranges we listed represent cross-industry averages. Your specific numbers will depend on traffic quality, landing page copy, and how well the lead magnet matches your audience's needs. A perfectly matched checklist in a niche market might beat a generic quiz aimed at everyone. Context matters. But as a general rule, interactive beats static across every industry we've seen data from.

**Can I use a Tier C lead magnet and still get good results?**

Yes, with caveats. A Tier C format works if you have high organic traffic (so even a low conversion rate produces decent volume), a very specific topic (not "Ultimate Guide to Marketing"), or you're using it as a secondary lead magnet rather than your main one. Most businesses we work with started with a PDF and upgraded to a quiz after seeing the performance gap firsthand.

**How much does it cost to build an interactive lead magnet?**

DIY with tools like Typeform or Interact: $0-$100/month plus 20-40 hours of your time. Done-for-you: $1,000-$5,000 depending on complexity. We build complete quiz funnels -- research, copy, design, scoring, 26 email sequences, analytics dashboard, deployment -- for [$2,500](/what-you-get).

## Pick a format and build it

You've seen 27 lead magnet examples ranked by what actually converts. The data is clear: interactive and personalized formats outperform static downloads by a wide margin. But a Tier C lead magnet that's live today beats a Tier A lead magnet that's still in your "someday" list.

If you're ready to skip the guesswork and build a quiz funnel that qualifies your leads automatically, that's what we do. Research, copy, scoring logic, personalized result pages, 26 email sequences, analytics dashboard. Done for you in two weeks.
