Most lead magnets give you an email address. That's it. Someone downloads your PDF, you get their email, and then you're guessing. Are they ready to buy? Are they a good fit? Did they even open the thing?

A **quiz funnel** gives you an email address *plus* intent data. By the time someone finishes your quiz, you know what they're struggling with, how serious they are about fixing it, and whether they're a fit for what you sell. That's not a lead. That's a qualified prospect.

We build quiz funnels for a living. We've been doing this long enough to know exactly what works, what doesn't, and where most people get tripped up. Before quiz funnels, we ran a food truck for four and a half years. We understand what it's like to be buried in the day-to-day work with zero time for marketing experiments that might not pan out. That's why quiz funnels clicked for us. Set it up once. Let it qualify leads while you're doing actual work.

This guide covers everything: what quiz funnels are, how they work mechanically, why they outperform static lead magnets, the different types you can build, and exactly what goes into building one. No theory. This is what we see every day building these systems for clients.

## TL;DR: quiz funnels in 60 seconds

A quiz funnel is a lead generation system built around an interactive quiz. Visitors land on a page, answer 5-7 questions, enter their email to get results, and receive a personalized outcome based on their answers.

Here's why that matters:

- **Conversion rates**: Quiz funnels convert at 30-50% on the quiz itself, compared to 10-15% for a good PDF lead magnet. The email capture step typically converts at 70-85% of quiz completers.
- **Lead quality**: Every answer is a data point. You know what problem they have, how urgent it is, and what solution fits them before you ever talk to them.
- **Automated qualification**: Each quiz response maps to a score. Hot leads get one email sequence. Warm leads get another. Cold leads get nurtured until they're ready. The system handles all of this.
- **Personalized results**: Instead of one generic PDF for everyone, each person gets a result page tailored to their specific situation. That makes the follow-up emails feel relevant, not spammy.

The bottom line: quiz funnels are the most effective lead generation tool for small businesses because they capture AND qualify in a single interaction. They take more upfront work than a PDF. But once they're running, they outperform everything else.

## What is a quiz funnel?

A **quiz funnel** is a marketing system that uses an interactive quiz as its lead capture mechanism instead of a static download. The "funnel" part means it's not just a quiz sitting on a page somewhere. It's a complete system: landing page, quiz experience, email capture, personalized results, and automated follow-up sequences.

Let's break that down.

A regular quiz is something you take for fun. "Which Office character are you?" That's entertainment. No business purpose.

A survey asks people for their opinions. It collects data for *your* benefit, not theirs. People know that, which is why survey response rates are terrible.

A quiz funnel is different from both. It asks strategic questions designed to help the person taking it. The questions lead somewhere useful: a personalized recommendation, an assessment of where they stand, a diagnosis of what's holding them back. The person gets genuine value from the result, and you get the data you need to follow up intelligently.

### The components

Every quiz funnel has these parts:

**Landing page** -- This is where people first encounter the quiz. It sells the quiz itself: why should someone spend 2-3 minutes answering questions? The answer is always the same: because the result they'll get is valuable. "Find out which lead generation strategy fits your business" is a compelling offer for someone who's struggling with leads.

**The quiz itself** -- Typically 5-7 questions. Each question is designed to do two things simultaneously: give the person a sense of progress toward their result AND collect data you can use for scoring and segmentation. Good quiz questions don't feel like they're evaluating you. They feel like they're *understanding* you.

**Email capture** -- This comes after the quiz questions but before the results. The timing matters. By this point, the person has invested 2-3 minutes answering questions. They want their result. The email capture feels like a reasonable ask, not a barrier. That's why 70-85% of people who finish the quiz also enter their email.

**Personalized result page** -- Not a generic "thanks for taking the quiz" page. A real result. Their score, their profile type, what it means, and what to do about it. This is where the quiz delivers on its promise.

**Automated email sequences** -- Based on the quiz results, each person enters a different email track. Someone scored as a hot lead gets a sequence focused on booking a call. Someone scored as warm gets educational content that builds toward a purchase decision. Someone cold gets value-first nurturing. The emails feel personal because they reference the quiz answers.

A [lead magnet funnel](/blog/lead-magnet-funnels-complete-guide) can use any type of lead magnet. A quiz funnel specifically uses an interactive quiz, and that distinction matters because of what happens with the data.

## How quiz funnels work

Let's walk through the exact flow. This is the mechanics of how a quiz funnel operates from the moment someone sees it to the moment they become a customer.

### Step 1: the landing page

The landing page has one job: get people to start the quiz. No sidebar. No navigation that leads elsewhere. A headline that speaks to what they'll learn about themselves, a brief description of what the quiz covers, and a start button.

What works on quiz landing pages:

- Outcome-focused headlines. "Find out your marketing score" beats "Take our quiz."
- Social proof near the start button. "2,400+ business owners have taken this quiz" reduces friction.
- Expected time. "Takes 2 minutes" removes the uncertainty about commitment.
- A preview of what they'll learn. Not the results themselves, but the categories. "You'll discover your lead generation style, your biggest conversion gap, and your recommended next step."

### Step 2: the questions

This is where quiz funnels separate from everything else. Each question serves a dual purpose.

**For the person taking it**: The question feels relevant and interesting. It makes them think about their situation in a useful way. Even before they see results, the questions themselves are providing a reflective experience.

**For your business**: Each answer maps to a scoring value. Behind the scenes, every answer choice has a weight. These weights add up to determine the person's result category and their lead temperature.

Here's what that looks like in practice. Say you run a coaching business. One of your quiz questions might be:

*"How are you currently getting new clients?"*
- Word of mouth and referrals (2 points)
- Social media content (3 points)
- Paid advertising (4 points)
- I'm not actively generating leads (1 point)

Someone relying entirely on word of mouth scores low because they're probably not ready for a system yet. Someone running paid ads but looking for better results? They're likely a hotter prospect.

**Question types matter more than most guides mention.** If every question is standard multiple choice, the quiz feels like a boring exam. The best quiz funnels mix it up:

- **Multiple choice** -- The standard. Good for straightforward questions with clear options.
- **Card selection** -- Visual options with icons or images. Great for "which describes you best" questions. Higher engagement than text-only options.
- **Scale sliders** -- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in your current lead generation?" Collects more detailed data and feels interactive.
- **Yes/no toggles** -- Quick binary questions that keep the pace moving. "Do you currently use email marketing? Yes / No."

We aim for at least 3-4 different question types in every quiz we build. That variety keeps people engaged through all 5-7 questions.

### Step 3: email capture

After the last question, before the results. This is the gate.

The reason this works so well is psychology. The person has already invested time and mental energy. They've answered questions about their business, thought about their challenges, and they're curious about the result. Leaving now means losing that investment. So they enter their email.

The best email capture screens include:

- A reminder of what they're about to get: "Your personalized marketing assessment is ready"
- Privacy reassurance: "We'll send your detailed results and won't spam you"
- A first-name field (optional but useful for email personalization)
- One button. No alternative paths.

### Step 4: the scoring logic

This happens instantly, behind the scenes. Every answer the person selected has a point value. Those points get tallied.

Most quiz funnels use a **temperature-based scoring system**:

- **Hot** (high score): Ready to take action. They have the problem, they know they need to fix it, and they have the budget or willingness to invest.
- **Warm** (medium score): Aware of the problem, interested in solutions, but not quite ready to commit. Needs more information or trust-building.
- **Cold** (low score): Early stage. May not fully recognize the problem yet, or isn't in a position to act on it right now.

More sophisticated quiz funnels also track *categories* alongside temperature. For example, someone might be a "hot" lead who's specifically struggling with lead quality (not lead volume). That category data shapes which result they see and which emails they get.

### Step 5: personalized result page

This is the payoff. The person sees their result, and it actually means something.

A good result page includes:

- Their profile name or score. "You're a Growth-Ready Investor" or "Your Marketing Score: 72/100."
- What it means. Two to three paragraphs explaining their result in the context of their business.
- Specific recommendations. Not generic advice. Recommendations that directly relate to their quiz answers.
- A call to action. For hot leads, this is "Book a free strategy call." For warm leads, "Download our detailed guide." For cold leads, "Watch this free training."

The CTA changes based on temperature. That's the power of quiz funnel marketing. You're not showing the same offer to someone who's ready to buy and someone who's still figuring out the problem.

### Step 6: automated email sequences

This is where the long-term value lives. After the result page, the email system takes over.

A typical quiz funnel has 3-5 different email sequences, one for each result type. Each sequence runs 5-14 emails over 2-4 weeks. The emails reference the person's specific quiz result, which makes them feel like personal follow-ups rather than mass emails.

Here's a sample sequence structure for a "warm" lead:

- **Email 1** (immediate): "Here's your full quiz result" -- Delivers detailed result with additional context
- **Email 2** (day 2): Educational content related to their specific challenge
- **Email 3** (day 4): Case study of someone with a similar profile who solved the problem
- **Email 4** (day 7): Common mistakes people with their profile make
- **Email 5** (day 10): "Ready to fix this?" -- Soft transition to your offer
- **Emails 6-14**: Mix of value and gentle selling, gradually increasing directness

A hot lead sequence moves faster. A cold lead sequence spends more time on education before introducing any offer. The [email sequences](/blog/how-quiz-funnels-generate-qualified-leads) are doing the selling so you don't have to.

## Why quiz funnels convert better

Quiz funnels don't outperform PDFs by accident. There are specific psychological mechanisms at work, and understanding them helps you build better ones.

### The curiosity gap

A quiz promises personalized information about *you*. Not generic advice. Not a one-size-fits-all document. A result that's specific to your answers. That's irresistible to most people.

Research from the Columbia Business School shows that personalized content generates 80% more engagement than generic alternatives. A quiz is the purest form of personalized content because the person literally shapes their own result through their answers.

### The sunk cost effect

After answering 5-7 questions, people don't want to leave without their result. They've invested time and thought. The email capture step sits right at the moment of maximum investment. This isn't manipulative. You're genuinely going to deliver something valuable. But the timing of the ask is why the conversion rate is so high.

Compare that to a PDF lead magnet: the visitor hasn't invested anything yet. Entering their email is the *first* action, not the culmination of an experience. There's no momentum carrying them forward. (We wrote a full breakdown of this in our [quiz funnels vs. PDF lead magnets](/blog/quiz-funnels-vs-pdf-lead-magnets) comparison.)

### Self-identification

This is the one most marketers miss.

When someone answers quiz questions about their business, they're not just providing data. They're telling themselves a story about where they are and what they need. By the time they see their result, they've already started to self-identify with the problem.

"You're a DIY Marketer who's spending 10+ hours a week on content but not seeing results" -- if that matches the answers they gave, it hits harder than any sales copy could. They said it about themselves. You're just reflecting it back.

### Personalized relevance

A PDF says the same thing to everyone. A quiz result speaks to a specific situation.

When follow-up emails reference someone's actual quiz answers, open rates run 40-60% higher than generic sequences. The emails feel relevant because they *are* relevant. That's not a marketing trick. It's what happens when you actually know something about the person you're emailing.

### The numbers

Here's what we consistently see across the quiz funnels we build:

| Metric | Quiz funnel | PDF lead magnet |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Landing page to start | 50-70% | N/A |
| Quiz completion rate | 75-85% | N/A |
| Email capture rate | 70-85% | 10-15% |
| Overall conversion | 30-50% | 10-15% |
| Email open rate (first email) | 65-80% | 40-50% |
| Lead quality score | High (qualified) | Unknown |

The standout number: lead quality. With a PDF, you have an email address and nothing else. With a quiz funnel, you have answers to 5-7 questions, a lead temperature score, and a category profile. That changes everything about how you follow up.

## Types of quiz funnels

Not all quiz funnels are the same. The type you choose depends on your business model, your audience, and what action you want people to take after getting their result. Here are the five main types, with real examples of how each one works.

### Assessment / scorecard

**What it does**: Evaluates where someone stands on a specific topic and gives them a score.

**Example**: "What's your marketing readiness score?" -- Questions about current lead gen methods, website conversion, email strategy, and ad spend. Result is a score out of 100 with a breakdown by category.

**Best for**: Consultants, coaches, and agencies who want to identify gaps they can fill. The assessment creates awareness of the problem, which your service solves. (If you're a coach, we wrote a separate guide on [lead magnets for coaches](/blog/lead-magnets-for-coaches) that goes deeper on this type.)

**Why it works**: People love benchmarks. "You scored 43/100 on lead generation readiness" creates urgency that "download our lead gen guide" never could.

### Personality / type

**What it does**: Sorts people into distinct categories based on their answers.

**Example**: "What's your business growth style?" -- Results might be "The Optimizer" (loves data, tweaks everything), "The Builder" (wants to create systems once and move on), "The Connector" (grows through relationships), or "The Experimenter" (tries everything, needs focus).

**Best for**: Coaches, personal brands, and course creators. The types create identity and belonging. People share their type, which drives organic traffic.

**Why it works**: The personality type becomes a label people adopt. "I'm a Builder, so I need a system that runs on autopilot" -- they've pre-sold themselves on the type of solution you offer.

### Recommendation engine

**What it does**: Recommends specific products, services, or next steps based on answers.

**Example**: "Which coaching program is right for you?" -- Questions about goals, experience level, time availability, and budget. Result recommends one of three programs with an explanation of why it's the best fit.

**Best for**: E-commerce brands, course creators with multiple offers, and service businesses with tiered packages. The quiz acts as a guided shopping experience.

**Why it works**: Removes decision paralysis. Instead of browsing four options and leaving confused, the quiz narrows it to one recommendation with reasoning.

### Diagnostic

**What it does**: Identifies what's broken or what's causing a problem.

**Example**: "Why isn't your funnel converting?" -- Questions about traffic sources, landing page setup, offer structure, and follow-up systems. Result pinpoints the likely bottleneck: "Your traffic is fine, but your follow-up is where leads are dropping off."

**Best for**: Service businesses and agencies that solve specific problems. The diagnosis names the problem, and your service is the treatment.

**Why it works**: Diagnosing a problem creates more urgency than describing a general benefit. "Your email follow-up has a 72-hour gap where leads go cold" is way more compelling than "improve your email marketing."

### Readiness evaluation

**What it does**: Determines if someone is ready for a specific next step.

**Example**: "Are you ready to hire a marketing agency?" -- Questions about current revenue, marketing budget, internal capacity, and goals. Result is either "Yes, you're ready and here's what to look for," "Almost--here's what to set up first," or "Not yet--here's what to focus on in the meantime."

**Best for**: High-ticket services where qualification matters. You don't want to get on calls with people who aren't ready. The quiz filters for you.

**Why it works**: It's honest. Telling someone "you're not quite ready yet, but here's how to get there" builds more trust than trying to sell everyone regardless of fit. Those "not ready yet" leads often come back 3-6 months later because you were straight with them.

## Building a quiz funnel: what you need

Building a quiz funnel is more involved than creating a PDF lead magnet. That's the honest trade-off. More upfront work, significantly better results. Here's every component you need and what each one does.

### 1. Audience research

Before you write a single question, you need to know your audience well enough to reflect their language back to them. This means understanding:

- The specific words they use to describe their problems (not your industry jargon)
- The 3-4 main segments within your audience and what differentiates them
- What outcome they'd find valuable enough to trade their email for
- What stage of awareness they're at when they encounter you

Skip this step and your quiz will feel generic. Nail it and people will think you read their mind.

### 2. Quiz architecture

This is the strategic layer. Before writing questions, you need to decide:

- **Quiz type**: Assessment, personality, recommendation, diagnostic, or readiness (see above)
- **Scoring model**: How will answers map to results? Simple additive scoring? Weighted categories? Both?
- **Result categories**: What are the 3-5 possible outcomes, and what does each one mean for follow-up?
- **Question flow**: What order creates the best experience? Usually start easy (warm-up questions) and get more specific.

We map all of this in a document before writing a single word of copy. It's like building a house. You need the blueprint before you start framing.

### 3. Landing page copy

The landing page needs to sell the quiz, not your product. The offer here is the quiz result itself. What will they learn about themselves? Why does that matter?

Strong quiz landing pages include:

- A headline focused on the outcome: "Find out your lead generation score in 2 minutes"
- A subheadline that adds specificity: "Answer 7 questions. Get your score + a personalized action plan."
- Brief bullets on what they'll discover
- Social proof (number of quiz takers, testimonials)
- A clear, prominent start button

### 4. Quiz questions and answer options

Each question needs to work on two levels: provide a good experience for the person and collect useful data for you.

Guidelines that we follow:

- **5-7 questions total**. Under 5 doesn't collect enough data. Over 7 and completion rates drop.
- **Mix up question types**. Two card selections, two scale sliders, two multiple choice, one yes/no toggle. Variety prevents fatigue.
- **4-5 answer options per question** (for multiple choice). Two feels too limited. Six overwhelms.
- **No "right" answers**. Every option should feel valid. If people think they're being judged, they'll game it or abandon.
- **Progressive depth**. Start with easy, low-stakes questions. Get more specific as they go.

### 5. Scoring system

Behind each answer is a point value. Those points determine the result.

A simple approach: each answer is worth 1-5 points. Add them up. 7-15 total = cold. 16-25 = warm. 26-35 = hot.

A better approach: weighted scoring. Some questions matter more for qualification. A question about budget or timeline might be worth 2x the points of a question about preferences. This gives you more accurate lead temperature readings.

The most sophisticated approach: category scoring. Track points across multiple dimensions. Someone might score high on "problem awareness" but low on "readiness to invest." That combination tells you they need education about ROI, not more problem agitation.

### 6. Result pages

You need a unique result page for each outcome. If you have 3 result categories and 3 temperature levels, that could mean up to 9 different result page variations (though most quiz funnels use 3-5).

Each result page should include:

- The result name and what it means
- A personalized description that reflects their answers
- 2-3 specific recommendations
- A temperature-appropriate CTA
- Social proof related to their specific result

### 7. Email sequences

This is where most DIY quiz funnels fall apart. People build the quiz and then connect it to a single generic email list. That defeats the entire purpose.

You need separate email sequences for each result type. At minimum, that's 3 sequences (hot, warm, cold). Better quiz funnels have 4-5 sequences aligned to specific result profiles.

Each sequence should be 5-14 emails sent over 2-4 weeks. The first email delivers the detailed result. Subsequent emails build on the quiz topic with content tailored to that person's specific situation.

We build 26-email sequences for our clients across 5 different tracks. That's 130 individual emails per quiz funnel. It's a lot of writing, but [the difference in results is significant](/blog/how-quiz-funnels-generate-qualified-leads).

### 8. Analytics and tracking

If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. Your quiz funnel needs tracking at every step:

- **Landing page views** -- How many people see the quiz?
- **Quiz starts** -- What percentage actually begin?
- **Question-by-question completion** -- Where do people drop off?
- **Email capture rate** -- What percentage enter their email after finishing?
- **Result page engagement** -- How long do they stay? Do they click the CTA?
- **Email open and click rates** -- Per sequence, not overall
- **Conversion to customer** -- The metric that actually matters

We build analytics dashboards into every quiz funnel. You can see exactly where leads are in the process, which questions cause drop-offs, and which email sequences perform best.

### Tech stack options

You have a few paths:

**SaaS quiz builders** (Typeform, Interact, ScoreApp): Easiest to set up. Limited customization. Monthly fees add up. Integration with email tools can be clunky. Fine for testing the concept.

**WordPress plugins** (Thrive Quiz Builder, etc.): More control than SaaS. Still limited on design and scoring logic. Dependent on your WordPress setup being stable.

**Custom-built** (what we do): Full control over design, scoring, question types, result pages, email sequences, and analytics. More expensive upfront, but no monthly platform fees and unlimited customization. This is the approach we take at Brothers Automate because it lets us build exactly what each client needs -- you can see a live example at [quiz.brothersautomate.com](https://quiz.brothersautomate.com).

The right choice depends on your budget, technical comfort, and how important the quiz is to your business. If it's your primary lead generation channel, custom is worth it. If you're testing the concept, a SaaS tool works fine.

## Quiz funnel best practices

After building quiz funnels for clients across multiple industries, these are the practices that consistently produce the best results.

### Keep it to 5-7 questions

We've tested shorter and longer. Under 5 questions and you don't collect enough data for meaningful personalization. Over 7 and completion rates drop sharply -- we've seen 15-20% decreases at the 8-question mark. The sweet spot is 7 questions. Enough depth without causing fatigue.

### Use visual question types

Walls of text multiple choice feel like a school exam. Card selection with icons, scale sliders, and toggle switches make the quiz feel like an interactive experience. This isn't just aesthetics. We see 10-15% higher completion rates on quizzes with mixed question types compared to text-only multiple choice.

### Front-load easy questions

Your first question should be a warm-up. Something the person can answer in 2 seconds without thinking hard. "What best describes your business?" with 4 clear options. Save the deeper questions for the middle of the quiz when they're committed.

### Personalize the result -- actually personalize it

"You're Type A! Here's some general advice" is not personalization. Real personalization means the result page references specific answers they gave. "You mentioned you're relying on word-of-mouth for new clients" -- that one line makes the entire result feel custom, because it is.

### Time your email capture correctly

After all questions, before results. Always. We've tested putting the email capture at different points and this position consistently wins. The curiosity about the result is at its peak. Putting it earlier means people haven't invested enough. Putting it after means they already have what they wanted.

### Segment your follow-up by result, not just by "took the quiz"

One email sequence for all quiz takers is a wasted opportunity. At minimum, use three sequences based on lead temperature. Better yet, create sequences aligned to specific result types. The more relevant the follow-up, the higher the conversion rate.

### Build for mobile first

60-70% of quiz takers are on their phones. If your quiz isn't dead simple to tap through on a 5-inch screen, you're losing the majority of your potential leads. Big buttons. Clear text. No horizontal scrolling. Progress indicators so they know how far they are.

## Common quiz funnel mistakes

We see these repeatedly from businesses that try to build quiz funnels without experience.

**Too many questions.** Twelve questions feels thorough to you. It feels exhausting to the person taking it. Every question past 7 costs you completions. Cut ruthlessly.

**All questions are the same type.** Seven multiple-choice questions in a row is monotonous. Mix in card selections, sliders, and toggles. Keep the format fresh.

**Generic results.** If your result page could apply to anyone, it's not doing its job. The person should read their result and think "that's exactly where I am." If they think "this is vague," you've lost them.

**No scoring strategy.** Assigning random point values to answers without thinking about what makes someone a hot vs. warm vs. cold lead. The scoring logic is what makes the entire system work. Spend time on it.

**Skipping the email sequences.** Building the quiz but dumping all leads into one generic email list. This is like qualifying leads and then ignoring the qualification data. Segment your follow-up.

**Ignoring analytics.** Launching the quiz and never looking at the data. Where do people drop off? Which questions cause abandonment? What's the email capture rate? You need these numbers to improve performance over time.

**Not having a clear CTA.** The result page needs to tell people what to do next. "Book a call" for hot leads, "download this resource" for warm leads, "watch this training" for cold leads. No CTA means a dead end.

## Frequently asked questions

### How long does it take to build a quiz funnel?

If you're doing it yourself with a SaaS tool, expect 20-40 hours for a solid quiz funnel including the email sequences. If you're hiring it out, a professional build takes about 7-14 days. The research and copy take longer than the tech build.

### What's a good conversion rate for a quiz funnel?

A quiz completion rate of 75-85% is strong. Email capture rate of 70-85% of completers is typical. Overall, if 30-50% of landing page visitors give you their email through a quiz funnel, you're performing well. Compare that to the 10-15% a good PDF lead magnet generates.

### Can I use a quiz funnel for e-commerce?

Yes. Product recommendation quizzes are one of the highest-converting types. "Find your perfect [product]" quizzes guide customers to the right product for their needs, reducing decision fatigue and returns. Skincare brands, supplement companies, and fashion retailers use them heavily.

### How many result types should I have?

Three to five. Fewer than three and the personalization feels thin. More than five and you're creating too many email sequences to maintain well. Three result types with temperature-based email variations (hot, warm, cold) gives you 9 possible paths, which is plenty of personalization.

### Do quiz funnels work for B2B?

Absolutely. B2B quiz funnels typically use the assessment or readiness evaluation format. "Is your team ready for [solution]?" or "What's your [area] maturity score?" These work because B2B buyers love benchmarks and self-assessments. The data you collect also helps your sales team tailor their outreach.

### What about quiz fatigue? Are people tired of quizzes?

No. BuzzFeed-style personality quizzes had a moment and faded. Business quiz funnels are a different thing entirely. People take them because they want a personalized answer to a real question, not because quizzes are trendy. As long as the result is genuinely valuable, engagement stays high. We haven't seen any decline in quiz funnel performance over the time we've been building them.

## Build a quiz funnel that qualifies leads while you sleep

A quiz funnel is more work upfront than creating a PDF or writing a checklist. That's the real trade-off, and we won't pretend otherwise.

But once it's live, it does something no other lead magnet can: it captures an email AND tells you exactly who that person is, what they need, and how ready they are to buy. Your follow-up becomes targeted instead of generic. Your sales conversations start with context instead of cold. Your time goes to leads who are actually qualified.

That's what we build at Brothers Automate. Quiz funnels are our thing. It's all we do. Research, copy, design, scoring logic, email sequences, analytics dashboard, deployment. The full system, done-for-you, for [$2,500](/what-you-get).
